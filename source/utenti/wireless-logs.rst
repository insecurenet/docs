Wireless Logs
=============

The Wireless logs can be found in the pfSenseÂ® webGUI under
**Status > System Logs** on the **System/Wireless** tab.

These logs contain entries from the *hostapd* daemon which handles
wireless access point connections. This process can be overly verbose
when handling client traffic, logging rekeys and other information that
can otherwise clutter the main system log.
