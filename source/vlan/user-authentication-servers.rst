Configuring User Authentication Servers
=======================================

In pfSenseÂ® software, authentication servers are managed centrally 
under **System > User Manager**, on the **Servers** tab. This central
location takes the place of the similar settings that used to be
present in many subsystems but managed separately.

LDAP or RADIUS servers may be added, and then they will available for
use in other places in the system such as OpenVPN, IPsec, or Captive Portal.

After adding an authentication source, it may be tested by visiting
**Diagnostics > Authentication**. Select an **Authentication Server**,
provide a **Username** and **Password**, then click **Test**. The result
will be displayed. Check the output of the test, the System Log, and
logs on the authentication server for more information.

When using an authentication server to control access to the pfSense
webGUI, group membership relies on the existence of a local group to match
the name of a group on the authentication server.
