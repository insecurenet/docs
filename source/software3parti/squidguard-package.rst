Configuring the SquidGuard Package
==================================

squidGuard is a URL redirector used to integrate blacklists with the
Squid proxy software. There are two big advantages to squidGuard: it is
fast and it is free. squidGuard is published under the GNU Public
License.

squidGuard can be used to:

-  Limit the web access for some users to a list of accepted/well known
   web servers and/or URLs only.
-  Block access to some listed or blacklisted web servers and/or URLs
   for some users.
-  Block access to URLs matching a list of regular expressions or words
   for some users.
-  Enforce the use of domain names/prohibit the use of IP addresses in
   URLs.
-  Redirect blocked URLs to an info page.
-  Redirect banners to an empty GIF.
-  Have different access rules based on time of day, day of the week,
   date etc.

Installing Squid and squidGuard

   **Available Packages** tab
#. Install the **Squid** package if it is not already installed.

Configure the squidGuard Package
--------------------------------

Basic configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here describes how to enable and configure squidGuard, and common users
access.

#. Open **General settings** tab.

   #. Check the **Enable** box to activate the package.
   #. Set **Blacklist** options to use blacklist categories. (See above,
      optional)
   #. Click **Save** button.

#. Open **Common ACL** page.

   #. Click **Target Rules List** to show defined blacklists and target
      categories

      #. Define default user access: select **Default access [all]** as
         *allow* or *deny*.
      #. Define other category actions:

         #. Select **---**, to ignore a category.
         #. Select **allow**, to allow this category for clients.
         #. Select **deny**, to deny this category for clients.
         #. Select **white**, to allow this category without any
            restrictions. This option is used for exceptions to
            prohibited categories.

      #. To prohibit clients from using IP addresses in URLs, check **Do
         Not Allow IP Addresses in URL**.
      #. Select **Redirect mode**:

         #. *Int error page*: Use the built-in error page. A custom
            message may be entered in the **Redirect info** box below.
         #. *Int blank page*: Redirect to a blank page
         #. The other options are various redirects to external error
            pages, and a URL must be entered in the **Redirect info**
            box if they are chosen.

      #. **Use safe search engine**: Protect customers from unwanted
         search results. It is supported by *Google, Yandex, Yahoo, MSN,
         Live Search*. Make sure that these search engines are
         available. If this protection should be strictly enforced,
         disable access to all other search engines.

#. After settings are complete, return to the **General Settings** tab
   and press **Apply**.

Blacklist
~~~~~~~~~

Blacklists are optional, but often useful for allowing access to certain
types of sites.

squidGuard comes with a small blacklist basically for testing purposes.
They should not be used in production. A better way is to start with one
of the blacklist collections listed (alphabetically) below.

-  `MESD blacklists <http://squidguard.mesd.k12.or.us/blacklists.tgz>`__
   - They are freely available.
-  `Shalla's
   Blacklists <http://www.shallalist.de/Downloads/shallalist.tar.gz>`__
   - Free for non commercial/private use. (Recommended)
-  `more.. <http://www.squidguard.org/blacklists.html>`__

Downloading blacklists:

#. Open **General Settings** tab in squidGuard package GUI, found at
   **Services > Proxy Filter**.
#. Check **Blacklist** to enable the use of blacklists.
#. Enter blacklist URL in the field **Blacklist URL**.
#. If the firewall is itself behind a proxy, enter the proxy information
   in **Blacklist proxy** (this step is not necessary for most people).
#. Click **Save**.
#. Navigate to the **Blacklist** tab inside of squidGuard.
#. Click the **Download** button.
#. Wait while blacklist will downloaded and prepared to use (10-35 min).
   Progress will be displayed on that page as the list is downloaded and
   processed.

How-Tos
-------

Exclude domain/URL from blacklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the squidGuard GUI (**Services > Proxy Filter**):

#. Open the **Target categories** page
#. Click |fa-plus| to add a new item
#. Enter a name for the category - ``myWhitelist`` for example.
#. Add domains and/or URLs to the lists as needed. Entries should be
   separated by a space. The examples on the page show how entries
   should be formatted.
#. As with the Common ACL discussed previously, redirect and logging
   options specific to this category may be set.
#. Click **Save**.
#. Open **Common ACL** or **Groups ACL** page (whichever should have an
   exclusion).
#. Click **Target Rule List** to expand the list of categories. The
   newly created category should show alphabetically in the list, above
   any blacklist categories. Find the **MyWhiteList** entry in the list
   and select **white**.
#. Click **Save**.
#. Return to the **General Settings** tab and press **Apply**.

Block download by Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the squidGuard GUI (**Services > Proxy Filter**):

#. Open the **Target categories** page.
#. Click |fa-plus| to add a new item.
#. Enter a name for the category - ``myBlockExt`` for example.
#. Add Expressions (for example for asf, zip, exe and etc files)::

     (.*\/.*\.(asf|wm|wma|wmv|zip|rar|cab|mp3|avi|mpg|swf|exe|mpeg|mp.|mpv|mp3|wm.|vpu))

#. Click **Save**.
#. Open **Common ACL** or **Groups ACL** page (whichever should have an
   exclusion).
#. Click **Target Rule List** to expand the list of categories. The
   newly created category should show alphabetically in the list, above
   any blacklist categories. Find the **myBlockExt** entry in the list and
   select **deny**.
#. Click **Save**.
#. Return to the **General Settings** tab and press **Apply**.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Netflix
~~~~~~~

If Netflix will not load while squidGuard is active, it is likely because
Netflix requires accessing URLs by IP address. Ensure that ACLs matching clients
allowed to reach Netflix also have **Do not allow IP-Addresses in URL**
unchecked.

Service Does Not Start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the squidGuard service will not start, there are a few possible
explanations:

- On all versions of Squid, if **only** blacklists have been configured, then at
  startup some important files/directories may not be set properly.

  - Add at least one **Custom Target Category** with a site to pass or block and
    use it along with the blacklist entries to work around the problem.

- On squid 3.x, the squidGuard service will only start when traffic requires it
  to run, so it can appear to be stopped even when working properly.

  - Only worry about the service if it appears to not work,
    don't count on the service status alone.
