Virtualizing pfSense with Proxmox
=================================

This following article is about building and running a pfSenseÂ® virtual
machine under Proxmox 4.4. The guide applies to any newer Proxmox
version. Article covers Proxmox networking setup and pfSense virtual
machine setup process. The guide does not cover how to install Proxmox.
A basic, working, pfSense virtual machine will exist by the end of this
article.

Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Proxmox host is up and running
-  Host has at least two network interfaces available for WAN and LAN.
-  you have already upload pfSense image to the host

Basic Proxmox networking
------------------------

In order to virtualize pfSense software, first create two Linux Bridges
on Proxmox, which will be used for LAN and WAN. Select your host from
the server view, navigate to System > Network. We will be using eth1 and
eth2 interfaces for the pfSense firewall, while eth0 is for Proxmox
management.

Click on create and select Linux Bridge. Under **Bridge ports** enter
eth1.

Repeat the process to add another Linux Bridge, this time add eth2 under
**Bridge ports**.

Proxmox Networking should now display two Linux bridges like on the
following screenshot. **WARNING:** Proxmox requires reboot if the
interfaces are not marked **Active**.

Creating pfSense virtual machine
--------------------------------

After creating WAN and LAN Linux bridges, now we proceed to create a new
virtual machine. Click on **Create VM** from the top right section and
new virtual machine wizard will appear. Under **General** tab, add a
name to your pfSense VM.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/screen_shot_2017-06-17_at_23.28.02.png

Under **OS** tab select **Other OS types** and click next.

   :align: center

On **CD/DVD** tab select local storage and under **ISO image** find the
previously uploaded pfSense ISO.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/screen_shot_2017-06-17_at_23.28.15.png
   :align: center

On the next tab, select **VirtIO** under Bus/Device and enter disk size
you need.

On the **CPU** tab select a single socket and add one or more cores.
Confirm CPU type is **Default (kvm64)**.

Under **Memory** tab add at least 1024 MB. Use fixed size memory.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/screen_shot_2017-06-17_at_23.29.17.png
   :align: center

On the **Network** tab select **Bridged mode** and **vmbr1**. Make sure
**VirtIO (paravirtualized)** is selected under **Model**.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/screen_shot_2017-06-17_at_23.29.29.png

Finally confirm the settings and wait for the VM to be created. Select
your newly created virtual machine from the server view sidebar.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/screen_shot_2017-06-17_at_23.29.46.png
   :align: center

While the pfSense virtual machine is selected, click on **Hardware**
settings and add another network device. Under **Bridge** enter
**vmbr2** and select **VirtIO (paravirtualized)** under **Model**.

Confirm your virtual machine has two network interfaces now.

Starting and configuring the pfSense virtual machine
----------------------------------------------------

After creating a new virtual machine and adding network interfaces, it's
time to start the virtual machine. If everything was done correctly, you
can see pfSense software booting up from the **Console** window.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/screen_shot_2017-06-17_at_23.30.32.png

The pfSense installer will prompt you to select boot mode, press **I** to
**launch the installer**.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/screen_shot_2017-06-17_at_23.31.06.png

When pfSense setup boots up, follow the installation steps as you would
on a physical device. Simply run Quick/Easy setup and wait for it to
complete. When prompted, select standard kernel. Click reboot to
complete the installation. Make sure you remove the .ISO from the
virtual CD/DVD media.

After pfSense virtual machine reboots you will be greeted by interfaces
assignment wizard. We will not set be setting up VLAN's now, so press
**N** and confirm

On the following steps assign the WAN and LAN interfaces. For the
purpose of this guide, we have assigned vtnet0 to WAN and vtnet1 to LAN.

After interfaces have been assigned, the pfSense firewall will complete the
boot process.

Configuring pfSense Software to work with Proxmox VirtIO
--------------------------------------------------------

After the pfSense installation and interfaces assignment is complete,
connect to the assigned LAN port from another computer.

.. warning:: Because the hardware checksum offload is not yet disabled,
   accessing pfSense webGUI might be sluggish. This is **NORMAL** and is
   fixed in the following step.

To disable hardware checksum offload, navigate under **System >
Advanced** and select **Networking** tab. Under **Networking
Interfaces** section check the **Disable hardware checksum offload** and
click save. Reboot will be required after this step.

**Congratulations, the pfSense virtual machine installation and
configuration on Proxmox is now complete.**
