Viewing Real-Time Traffic Graphs
================================

The single traffic graph view under **Status > Traffic Graph** displays
a live SVG graph of the traffic on a single interface. This interface
can be changed by picking a different one from the available drop-down
list.

A table is shown to the right of the graph that includes IP address and
traffic information for the top few IP addresses transferring traffic in
a small interval. The sorting and filtering controls at the top of the
page can fine-tune this output.
