Monitoring Graphs
=================

pfSenseÂ® software has many built-in graphs that monitor different
aspects of the system, and they work out-of-the-box with no
intervention.

These are located under **Status > Monitoring**. Several graphs are
presented for each monitored item, with varying time intervals and
averages.

These graphs measure things such as CPU usage, memory usage, state table
usage, throughput (in bytes as well as packets), link quality, traffic
shaping queue usage, and so on.
