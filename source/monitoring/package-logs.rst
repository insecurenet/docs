Package Logs
============

In pfSenseÂ® software, packages which support logging to this central
location will have their logs displayed here. If a package's logs do
not show up, contact the package maintainer to see if the package can
be updated to support this mechanism.

Some packages will log to the main system log or a related tab inside
the system logs (**Status > System Logs**). Others may keep their own
logs in a separate location. Some packages, such as Squid and Snort,
offer configuration options to control where and how logs are made. Some
logs may need to be viewed outside the webGUI or via 
**Diagnostics > Command**.
