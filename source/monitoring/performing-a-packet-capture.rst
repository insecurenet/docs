Performing a Packet Capture
===========================

A packet capture may be performed within the pfSenseÂ® webGUI under
**Diagnostics > Packet Capture**. The settings work the same as
tcpdump. The capture can be viewed in the GUI or downloaded for later
viewing with tcpdump or `Wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org/>`__.

Various filters may be added to restrict the scope of the capture, such
as a specific **Protocol**, **Host address**, or **Port** (among
others). The size of the capture may be adjusted as well. Often a few
thousand packets are necessary to catch certain activity.

The **Level of detail** selector only controls the level of detail
displayed in the pfSense webGUI for viewing the contents of a capture.
It may be adjusted after a capture has been taken, to view the capture
with more detail, adjust this value and click **View Capture**.

Click **Start** to start a capture. While a capture is running, a
**Stop** button is also displayed to stop a capture in progress.

**View Capture** shows the contents of the previous capture.

**Download Capture** initiates a download of the capture file for
viewing locally (or sending to a remote technician.)

tcpdump
-------

``tcpdump`` comes installed with pfSense software. It can be used over SSH
or on the console in a shell. In this example a method of capturing
traffic other than SSH, ARP, DNS and STP is highlighted. The capture
will be directed to a file called **Sniff_output** in the current directory.

.. code-block:: none

   tcpdump -i em0 not port 22 and not port 53 and not arp and not stp >> Sniff_output

The ``-i`` is designating traffic from the em0 interface. In this example
traffic from one of the subnets em0 connected to a pfSense instance is
being grabbed.

.. seealso:: For more information on ``tcdump``, see `Using tcpdump from the
   command line`_.

iftop
-----

A second method of sniffing traffic via a shell is with iftop, which is available
in the package repository.

iftop allows designating the interface from which to grab traffic.

In this example em1 is the LAN Interface:

.. code-block:: none

   iftop -i em1

Sample Output:

.. code-block:: none

   cf-in-f18.google.com              => 192.168.1.245                        0b
                                     <=                                      0b
   cf-in-f97.google.com              => 192.168.1.245                        0b
                                     <=                                      0b
   cf-in-f103.google.com             => 192.168.1.245                        0b
                                     <=                                      0b
   google.navigation.opendns.com     => 192.168.1.245                        0b
                                     <=                                      0b

pftop
-----

pftop is a tool built into pfSense software that can monitor
traffic/connections. This tool can be found in the webGUI under
**Diagnostics > pftop** or by connecting to the pfSense firewall
via SSH or the console.
