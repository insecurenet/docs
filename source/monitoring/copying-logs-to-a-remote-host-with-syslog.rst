Copying Logs to a Remote Host with Syslog
=========================================

To retain logs for any significant period of time, remote syslog must be
enabled and a syslog server must be configured to accept log messages
from pfSenseÂ® software.

There are several different syslog server software packages. Most
BSD/Linux systems will have one built in, and there are some free
utilities available for Windows to accept syslog messages from remote
hosts.

Setup Syslog on the Logging Host
--------------------------------

First, configure the syslog server to accept remote connections which
means running it with the ``-a <subnet>`` or similar flag.

   .. tab:: Windows

      Setting this up on Windows entirely depends on which syslog server is
      being used. Consult the documentation for more information on
      configuration.

      There is a free multi-purpose utility that can act as a syslog server,
      which can be found here: http://tftpd32.jounin.net/

      Kiwi Syslog Server is free for up to 5 devices.

   .. tab:: Linux

      Configuration of the system logger on Linux depends on the distribution.
      Consult the distribution's documentation on how to change the behavior of
      **syslogd**. It should be similar in many cases to the alterations in the
      FreeBSD section.

   .. tab:: FreeBSD

      On FreeBSD, edit **/etc/rc.conf** and add this line::

        syslogd_flags=" -a 192.168.1.1 "

      Where ``192.168.1.1`` is the IP address of the pfSense firewall.

      More complex allow rules for syslog are also possible, like so::

        syslogd_flags=" -a 10.0.10.0/24:*"

      Using that parameter, syslog will accept from any IP address in the
      10.0.10.0 subnet (mask 255.255.255.0) and the messages may come from any
      UDP port.

      Now, edit ``/etc/syslog.conf`` and add a block at the bottom::

        !*
        +*
        
        +pfSense
        *.*                /var/log/pfsense.log

      Where ``pfSense`` is the hostname of the pfSense firewall. An entry may
      also need to be added in **/etc/hosts** for that system, depending on the
      DNS setup. Logs may be split separate files. Use the **/etc/syslog.conf**
      file on the pfSense firewall for more details on which logging facilities
      are used for specific items.

      The log file may also need to be created manually with proper
      permissions::

        touch /var/log/pfsense.log
        chmod 640 /var/log/pfsense.log

      Now restart syslog::

        /etc/rc.d/syslogd restart

   .. tab:: OpenBSD

      The configuration for OpenBSD is similar to FreeBSD, with the following
      notes:

      #. The option to accept remote syslog events is ``-u``.
      #. This option may be enabled using *rcctl(8)*::

          rcctl set syslogd flags -u

      #. To restart the syslogd service::

          rcctl restart syslogd

Other Logging Servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Other log systems such as Splunk, ELSA, or ELK may also be used but the
methods for implementing them are beyond the scope of this document. If
such a system is syslog-compatible, then the pfSense software side should
be fairly simple to setup as it would be for any other syslog system.

Setup pfSense Software for Remote Logging
-----------------------------------------

* Click **Status > System Logs**.
* Click the **Settings** tab.
* Check **Enable syslog'ing to remote syslog server**.
* Type the IP of the logging server in the box next to **Remote syslog server**.
* Check the boxes for the log entries to forward.
* Click **Save**.

Log messages will begin flowing to the target system.
