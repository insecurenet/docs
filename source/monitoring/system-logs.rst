System Logs
===========

Logs for the firewall and related processes may all be found under
**Status > System Logs**.

Logs messages generated by pfSenseÂ® software, the Operating System, and
other applications which do not have their own logging tabs show on the
first tab, **System** on the **General** sub-tab.

If something is not working properly, a message may be found here
indicating an error condition or informational messages about system
activity.

Logs for other subsystems are located on individual tabs at the top of the log
view. Click on a tab to view one of the other logs, or click the :doc:`Settings
</monitoring/log-settings>` tab to make changes to the logging behavior.
