Avahi package
=============

The `Avahi`_ package used in pfSenseÂ® software is a system which
facilitates service discovery on a local network. This means that a
laptop or computer may be connected into a network and instantly be
able to view other people to chat with, find printers to print to
or find files being shared.

This kind of technology is already found in Apple MacOS X (branded
Rendezvous, Bonjour, and sometimes Zeroconf) and is very convenient.
Avahi is mainly based on Lennart Poettering's flexmdns mDNS
implementation for Linux which has been discontinued in favour of Avahi.
