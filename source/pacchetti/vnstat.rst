Status Traffic Totals
=====================

This package displays different ways to view the traffic usage generated by the
network traffic monitoring tool `vnStat`_.

.. seealso:: Similar tools are available for pfSense bandwith monitoring
   :doc:`How can I monitor bandwidth usage </monitoring/monitoring-bandwidth-usage>`

Notes
-----

Every NIC is added on install. So if a NIC is added (or removed) on the
pfSenseÂ® box, remove the package and install again. If the pfSense
router has data for a NIC vnStat will report the data even if the NIC
has been removed.


A reinstall of the package will not change this as the core pfSense
system has data pertaining to the non existent data and thus other
packages such as vnstat2 will report the data it has or has found

Known Issues
