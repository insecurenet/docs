The NUT package provides a way to monitor an `Uninterruptable Power Supply`_
(UPS) using `Network UPS Tools`_ (NUT).

After installation, the package may be configured at **Services > UPS**.

Troubleshooting
---------------

The package does not have a lot of input validation in the webGUI. If NUT
will not start after configuration, check the System log from the pfSenseÂ®
webGUI from **Status > System Logs**) for log entries starting with 
``nut:``. The culprit is likely explained there, such as selecting a cable
for a driver type that does not need (nor permit) the cable selection.

If the system log doesn't offer adequate information, such as simply logging::

  nut: Service failed to start: check configuration

Log in via SSH and choose option ``8``, then run the following command::

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nut.sh start

Configuration errors will be displayed in the output if any are found.
