the kernel modules.

Verifying vmtoolsd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Navigate to **Diagnostics > Command**, and in **Execute shell command**,
enter the following::

  ps uxawww | grep vmtoolsd

Output similar to the following will be shown::

  $ ps uxawww | grep vmtoolsd
  1026  ??  Ss     0:20.84 /usr/local/bin/vmtoolsd -c /usr/local/share/vmware-tools/tools.conf -p /usr/local/lib/open-vm-tools/plugins/vmsvc
  19157  ??  SN     0:00.00 sh -c ps ax|grep vmware
  19159  ??  RN     0:00.00 grep vmware (sh)

As long as **vmtoolsd** is shown in the output, it is working.
