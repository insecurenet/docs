Features
--------

The features below were tested on pfSense software version 2.x

- Authentication with Captive-Portal
- Pre-defined user attributes and custom check-items and reply-items
- NAS/Clients running on IPv4 and IPv6
- Interfaces can listen on IPv4 and IPv6
- OpenVPN + Username + RADIUS and OpenVPN + Username + Cert + RADIUS
- Auth with PAP, CHAP, MSCHAP, MSCHAPv2
- Auth with EAP-MD5 + dynamic VLAN assignment
- Auth with PEAP + dynamic VLAN assignment
- Auth with EAP-TLS/EAP-TTLS + dynamic VLAN assignment

  .. code-block:: none

     radiusd[3206]: Login OK: [testuser/<via Auth-Type = EAP>] (from client pfsense port 0 cli 00-04-23-5C-9D-19)
     radiusd[3206]: Login OK: [testuser/<via Auth-Type = EAP>] (from client pfsense port 0 cli 00-04-23-5C-9D-19)
     radiusd[3206]: Login OK: [testuser/<via Auth-Type = EAP>] (from client pfsense port 0 via TLS tunnel)
     radiusd[3206]: Login OK: [testuser/<via Auth-Type = EAP>] (from client pfsense port 0 via TLS tunnel)

- Simultaneous-Use - The following will be present in the system log

  .. code-block:: none

     radiusd[3206]: Multiple logins (max 1) : [testuser/testpw] (from client testing port 10)

- A certain amount of time per day/week/month/forever (``CHECK-ITEM:
  Max-Daily-Session := 60``) The user will be disconnected and cannot
  re-login after the amount of time is reached:

  .. code-block:: none

     radiusd[3206]: Invalid user (rlm_counter: Maximum daily usage time reached): [testuser/<via Auth-Type = EAP>] (from client pfsense port 0 cli 00-04-23-5C-9D-19)

- A certain amount of traffic per day/week/month/forever. The user will
  be disconnected and cannot re-login after the amount of traffic is
  reached. The syslog output looks like this:

  .. code-block:: none

     root: FreeRADIUS: Used amount of daily upload and download traffic by testuser is 0 of 100 MB! The user was accepted!!!
     root: FreeRADIUS: Credentials are probably correct but the user testuser has reached the daily amount of upload and download traffic which is 243 of 100 MB! The user was rejected!!!

- MySQL
- LDAP/ActiveDirectory (connecting to MS AD with PAP)
- User-Auth with SQUID
- One-Time-Password

Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

-  Navigate to **System > Packages**, **Available Packages** tab.
-  Click |fa-plus| at the end of the row for **freeradius3**.
-  Confirm the installation.
-  Monitor the progress as it installs.

After Installation, the service may be configured at **Services >
FreeRADIUS**.

- Select the **interface(s)** on which the RADIUS server should listen on.
- Configure the **NAS/client(s)** from which the RADIUS server should accept
  packets.
- Add the **user(s)** who should have access.

After this, have a look at the pfSenseÂ® syslog. There should be the
following:

.. code-block:: none

   radiusd[16634]: Ready to process requests.
   radiusd[16627]: Loaded virtual server


Troubleshooting RADIUS Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When attempting to authenticate against a RADIUS server, errors may be
encountered in the logs that prevent it from working properly. Here are some
errors and how to resolve them:

.. code-block:: none

   mpd: [pt0] RADIUS: RadiusSendRequest: rad_init_send_request failed: -1

* This appears to happen when the RADIUS shared secret contains special
  characters. Try again with an alphanumeric shared secret.


Get FreeRADIUS Status Server Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The status server will give lots of information about the FreeRADIUS
server. Many stats are shown about Accounting-Packets, dropped packets
and much more. To enable status server and request information from the
server do the following:

- Setup an interface with **Interface-Type**: *status* and a free port.
  The default port for RADIUS accounting is ``1813``.
- Setup a NAS/Client with **IP-Address**: ``127.0.0.1`` and a password.
  Password *testing123* will be used in this how-to.
- SSH to the pfSense firewall and enter the following command on the
  command line:

  .. code-block:: none

     echo "Message-Authenticator = 0x00, FreeRADIUS-Statistics-Type = All" | \radclient localhost:1813 status testing123

The output should look like this:

.. code-block:: none

   Received response ID 223, code 3, length = 140
          FreeRADIUS-Total-Access-Requests = 1
          FreeRADIUS-Total-Access-Accepts = 0
          FreeRADIUS-Total-Access-Rejects = 14
          FreeRADIUS-Total-Access-Challenges = 0
          FreeRADIUS-Total-Auth-Responses = 14
          FreeRADIUS-Total-Auth-Duplicate-Requests = 0
          FreeRADIUS-Total-Auth-Malformed-Requests = 0
          FreeRADIUS-Total-Auth-Invalid-Requests = 0
          FreeRADIUS-Total-Auth-Dropped-Requests = 0
          FreeRADIUS-Total-Auth-Unknown-Types = 0

To request other status updates, replace **FreeRADIUS-Statistics-Type =
1** from the command above with another value. More values can be found
in this path on the pfSense firewall:
