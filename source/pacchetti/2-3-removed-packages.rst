2.3 Removed Packages
====================

The available package list in pfSenseÂ® software version 2.3 has been
trimmed down significantly, mostly removing packages that have been
deprecated upstream, no longer have an active maintainer, or were never
stable to begin with. Some just haven't been converted for Bootstrap
and may return if converted. The following lists packages no longer
available in 2.3 that were in the package list in 2.2.6.

Systems with one of these packages installed can be upgraded, but the
package will no longer be there post-upgrade. We recommend uninstalling
these packages before upgrading to 2.3:

-  Apache with mod_security-dev / Proxy Server with mod_security -
   neither ever worked well, no active maintainer.
