iperf package
=============

`iperf`_ is a tool used for network throughput testing.

Usage
-----

iperf running on pfSenseÂ® software is NOT a suitable way of testing
firewall throughput, as there is a significant difference between
performance of traffic *initiated or terminated on the firewall*
and traffic *traversing the firewall*. There are many suitable uses
for iperf running on pfSense software, but testing the throughput
capabilities of the firewall is not one of them.

Uses for iperf on pfSense software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Measuring throughput from the internal network to the inside of the
  firewall

  * Useful in scenarios where portions of the internal network are behind
    links slower than the firewall's network interface. Examples include
    testing the throughput of a wireless network or private WAN network
    connected to a router inside the network.

* Testing end to end throughput between two firewalls on the Internet

* Anything else where performance measurement excluding throughput
  capabilities of the firewall are desirable.
