Captive Portal
==============

The **Captive Portal** function in pfSenseÂ® software allows securing a
network by requiring a username and password (or only a click through),
entered on a portal page.

Authentication can be performed using pfSense the pfSense built-in user management,
or an external authentication server such as a RADIUS server or an
LDAP server.


.. tip:: The best source of captive portal information can be found in the |book_link|.


Captive Portal can be configured from **Services > Captive Portal**, where **Zones**
can be created or updated.

Captive portal **Zone** allow for the creation of separate, independent
portals that operate on one or more separate interfaces. For example,
there could be a zone for Wireless and a zone for Wired. Each zone has a
completely isolated set of pages, configuration, users, etc.

One zone may be used by multiple interfaces, but an interface can be bound to only one
zone.

When creating a captive portal zone, several tabs are available for the captive portal setup,
each described below:


Captive Portal Tab
------------------

General management of captive portal setup and authentication. Each
option is described in detail on the page

Pass-Through MAC Tab
--------------------

Allows managing a list of MAC
addresses which are allowed to bypass the portal.

These MAC addresses will bypass the portal authentication.

Allowed IP addresses
--------------------

Allows managing a list of IP
addresses which can either:

-  Always connect **from** behind the portal (clients)
-  Always allow clients **to** an IP address (external servers)

These IP addresses will bypass the portal authentication in the
direction specified.

Vouchers
--------

One-time use portal access codes, described in more detail in:
:doc:`Captive Portal Vouchers </captiveportal/captive-portal-vouchers>`.

File Manager
------------

Allows management of the files
which can be used to make up the contents of the captive portal
authentication/click-through page.
