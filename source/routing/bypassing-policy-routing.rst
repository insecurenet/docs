Bypassing Policy Routing
========================

The Multi-WAN capability of pfSenseÂ® software uses the *route-to*
functionality in pf to direct traffic out via specific gateways.
Rules that match traffic to send connections out a specific WAN
can cause local or VPN traffic destinations to exit the firewall
WAN rather than following local routing, which is likely not the
intended effect.

To ensure proper delivery of local or VPN routed traffic, or other
external traffic that must obey the system routing table, rules must be
crafted to pass the traffic *without a gateway set*.

An example:

In **Firewall > Rules**, on the **LAN Tab**, create this as the
*topmost* rule, or at least above all other rules that have a gateway
configured:

-  **Proto**: \*
-  **Source**: \*
-  **Port**: \*
-  **Destination**: *192.168.1.0/24* (LAN Subnet, or DMZ subnet, or VPN
   subnet, etc.)
-  **Port**: \*
-  **Gateway**: \* (Default)

The destination could also be an Alias containing all local/VPN
networks. Commonly, an RFC1918 alias is created and used in such rules
to match all possible privately numbered traffic. Such an RFC1918 alias
should contain *192.168.0.0/16*, *172.16.0.0/12*, and *10.0.0.0/8*.
