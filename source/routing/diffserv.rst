Traffic Shaping with Differentiated Services (DiffServ) Identifiers
===================================================================

pfSense® software supports **Differentiated services** (**DiffServ**) for traffic
filtering or queue assignments. DiffServ takes the place of the outdated **Type
of service** (**TOS**). DiffServ uses the upper six bits of the TOS field in the
IP header (the six bits being called the *DiffServ Code Point field*), while the
lower two bits are reserved for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).

Unless appropriately configured, pfSense software ignores the content of the
DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) field. To prioritize traffic, the
:doc:`traffic-shaping-guide` needs to be set up accordingly.

.. warning:: pfSense software *does not* support the setting or changing of
   DiffServ values, only matching.

Supported DiffServ Code Point Values
------------------------------------

Note that the interpretations of the DSCP values, as provided by the various
RFCs, are only given as a reference. How the DSCP values are interpreted in any
specific setup is entirely up to the user or end nodes.

The **Assured Forwarding** (AF) Behavior Group is recommended in `RFC 2597`_.

.. table:: Assured Forwarding (AF) Behavior Group values

   +------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
   | Precedence | Class 1 (lowest) | Class 2          | Class 3          | Class 4 (highest)|
   +============+==================+==================+==================+==================+
   | Low Drop   | AF11 (10/0x0a)   | AF21 (18/0x12)   | AF31 (26/0x1a)   | AF41 (34/0x22)   |
   +------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
   | Med Drop   | AF12 (12/0x0c)   | AF22 (20/0x14)   | AF32 (28/0x1c)   | AF42 (36/0x24)   |
   +------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
   | High Drop  | AF13 (14/0x0e)   | AF23 (22/0x16)   | AF33 (30/0x1e)   | AF43 (38/0x26)   |
   +------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+

For low-drop/low-latency traffic, use EF and VA DSCP values.

.. table:: Expedited Forwarding (EF) and Voice Admit (VA) values

   +-----------------------------+--------------+---------------+
   | PHB                         | DSCP Value   | RFC           |
   +=============================+==============+===============+
   | Expedited Forwarding (EF)   | 46/0x2e      | `RFC 3246`_   |
   +-----------------------------+--------------+---------------+
   | Voice Admit (VA)            | 44/0x2c      | `RFC 5865`_   |
   +-----------------------------+--------------+---------------+

The Class Selector (CS) PHB group has been retained from TOS.

.. table:: Class Selector (CS) values

   +------------------+--------------+
   | Class Selector   | DSCP Value   |
   +==================+==============+
   | CS1              | 8/0x08       |
   +------------------+--------------+
   | CS2              | 16/0x10      |
   +------------------+--------------+
   | CS3              | 24/0x18      |
   +------------------+--------------+
   | CS4              | 32/0x20      |
   +------------------+--------------+
   | CS5              | 40/0x28      |
   +------------------+--------------+
   | CS6              | 48/0x30      |
   +------------------+--------------+
   | CS7              | 56/0x38      |
   +------------------+--------------+

To provide limited backward comparability to TOS, pfSense also recognizes the
following DSCP/TOS values.

.. table:: TOS Compatibility values

   +---------------+--------------+-------------+
   | TOS           | DSCP Value   | TOS value   |
   +===============+==============+=============+
   | reliability   | 1/0x01       | 4/0x04      |
   +---------------+--------------+-------------+
   | throughput    | 2/0x02       | 8/0x08      |
   +---------------+--------------+-------------+
   | lowdelay      | 4/0x04       | 16/0x10     |
   +---------------+--------------+-------------+

pfSense only matches exact values. All six bit in the DSCP field must match.

Caveats
-------

By default, pfSense matches only the first packet of a connection, which is the
packet that creates an entry in the state table. If a connection starts with a
different DSCP value, has no DSCP value in the starting packet, or otherwise
changes DSCP values during the connection, the traffic will not be classified as
expected.

.. tip:: This can be worked around by using "no state" rules, but crafting these
   rules in a secure manner is difficult, so it is not a workaround that we
   recommend.

Adding additional DSCP values for experimental use
--------------------------------------------------

Assuming basic knowledge about PHP, it is possible to add additional DiffServ
Code Point values by editing ``/usr/local/www/guiconfig.inc``. In this file, the
variable ``$firewall_rules_dscp_types`` is initialized with an array containing
the recognized DSCP values. New values can be specified as hex values,
optionally followed by a blank and a comment like, for example::

  "0x03",

Valid values are in the range ``0x01`` through ``0x3f``.

.. caution:: These changes will be lost upon a firmware update.
