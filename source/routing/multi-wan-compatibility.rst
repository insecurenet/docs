Multi-WAN Compatibility
=======================

Outbound traffic to the Internet
--------------------------------

All services running locally on pfSenseÂ® software will strictly obey
the system's routing table. This means they go out the primary WAN
unless static routes are defined that match the traffic. This only
applies to services which initiate connections to the Internet, such
as the DNS forwarder, and several packages such as squid.

Inbound traffic from Internet
-----------------------------

On current versions of pfSense software, from the perspective of
traffic coming in to services on pfSense from the Internet, connections
will return through the WAN which they entered. This works for TCP-based
services and UDP services bound to specific IP addresses. For UDP
services bound to any/all IP addresses, there may still be issues with
return traffic as UDP will attempt to reply from the closest interface
IP address to the client.

Web site incompatibility with changing IP addresses
---------------------------------------------------

Some websites do not work properly if requests from the LAN are
initiated from multiple public IP addresses. Hence load balancing is
incompatible with these sites. Common examples are sites that maintain
login sessions, most frequently online banking. This is most commonly
observed with HTTPS sites so usually HTTPS should not be load balanced.
Occasionally it is a problem with HTTP sites that maintain session, but
this is rare.

For sites that do not function with load balancing, add firewall rules
to not load balance traffic to these destinations or protocols.
