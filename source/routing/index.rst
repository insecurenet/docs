Routing and Multi-WAN
*********************

A core feature of any firewall or router is making decisions about where to send
packets. In pfSenseÂ® software, gateways are hosts which forward traffic to other
networks. Packets can be routed to a gateway based on their destination in a
traditional way (static routes), based on firewall rule matching criteria
(policy routing), or even to multiple gateways for load balancing or failover
(multi-wan).
