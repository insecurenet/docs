Using Multiple WAN Connections
==============================

Multiple WAN connections are supported using Gateway Groups. Any number
of them may be PPPoE, DHCP, static, etc. Multi-Link PPP (MLPPP) is also
supported for bandwidth aggregation of multiple links on DSL providers
that support the technology.

Multi-WAN IPv6 is also possible, see :doc:`Multi-WAN for IPv6 </routing/multi-wan-for-ipv6>`

   For guides on implementing Multi-WAN, see :doc:`Multi-WAN
   </routing/multi-wan>` and/or :doc:`/interfaces/multi-link-ppp-mp-mlppp`.
