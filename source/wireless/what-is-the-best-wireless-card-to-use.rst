What is the best wireless card to use
=====================================

Most of the developers use Atheros-based cards, and as such, they are
the most tested cards. For mini-PCIe cards, we use a number of WLE200NX
cards. Any Atheros-based card should work well. These are available from
`Netgate <http://store.netgate.com/WLE200NX-80211nabg-miniPCIe-Card-P1763.aspx>`__
and other vendors.

Some other types of cards are supported and should work fine, and at
least one developer uses a Ralink card with good results, though others
have reported numerous stability problems with non-Atheros cards.

A matrix of cards and supported modes, with information gathered from
man pages, drivers, and user feedback may be found `in this
