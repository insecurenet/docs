Using the pfSense Dashboard
===========================

The pfSenseÂ® dashboard is the main page of the firewall, and it makes
monitoring various aspects of the system easy. Returning to the
dashboard can be accomplished by clicking the logo in the upper left, or
by navigating to **Status > Dashboard**.

The Dashboard is composed of Widgets, each of which display information
about a different area of the firewall. The current list of widgets
includes (in Alphabetical Order):

-  Captive Portal Status
-  Carp Status
-  Dynamic DNS Status
-  Firewall Logs
-  Gateways
-  Gmirror Status
-  HAVP Alerts (installable add-on widget)
-  Installed Packages
-  Interface Statistics
-  Interfaces
-  IPsec Status
-  Load Balancer Status
-  NTP Status
-  OpenVPN Status
-  Pictures
-  RSS Feed
-  Services Status
-  S.M.A.R.T. Status
-  Snort Alerts (installable add-on widget)
-  System Information
-  Thermal Sensors
-  Traffic Graphs
-  Wake on LAN

A widget can be added to the dashboard by clicking |fa-plus| at the top of the
screen, then choosing the widget from the list. Once the widget appears,
its placement may be changed by dragging its title bar to another
location on the screen. The widget will snap into place in one of two
columns, and can be reordered as desired.

Click **Save Settings** at the top of the screen after making any widget
layout changes.

Some widgets will have their own settings, which may be accessed by
pressing the wrench icon in their title bar. To save these settings use
the **Save** button **inside** the widget, not the button at the top of
the page.

New widgets may be written as described at
:doc:`../development/creating-widgets`.
