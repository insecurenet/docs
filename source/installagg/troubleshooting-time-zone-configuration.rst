Troubleshooting Time Zone Configuration
=======================================

If the clock is several hours off, but accurate to the minute, it is
most likely a time zone setting issue. If using a GMT offset time (e.g.
*-0500*), try using a more specific **geographic** time zone such as
*America/New_York* instead.

Processes on FreeBSD (and thus pfSenseÂ® software) only pick up time
changes when they are started. If the firewall has not been rebooted
since the last time zone change, doing so will ensure that all running
processes are using the correct time zone.
