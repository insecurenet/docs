DHCP Logs
=========

The DHCP log view at **Status > System Logs** on the **DHCP** Tab,
displays messages and events from the DHCP Daemon and the DHCP client
for WANs.

Each DHCP request and reply from DHCP clients is shown here, along with
events and errors. IP addresses, MAC addresses, and client-supplied
hostnames are all visible in the logs.
