2.4.5 New Features and Changes
==============================

pfSenseÂ® software version 2.4.5 contains a variety of bug fixes and maintenance
updates.

.. warning:: **Proceed with caution when upgrading pfSense software while
   COVID-19 travel restrictions are in effect.**

   During this time of travel limitations, remote upgrades of pfSense software
   should be carefully considered, and avoided where possible. Travel
   restrictions may complicate any repair of any issue, including
   hardware-related issues that render the system unreachable. Should these
   issues require onsite physical access to remedy, repair of the issue may not
   be possible while travel restrictions related to COVID-19 are in effect.

.. tip:: For those who have not yet updated to 2.4.4-p3 or 2.4.4, consult
   the :doc:`previous release notes <index>` and `blog posts for those releases
   <https://www.netgate.com/blog/category.html#releases>`__ to read all
   important information and warnings before proceeding.
