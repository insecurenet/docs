2.1.3 New Features and Changes
==============================

pfSenseÂ® software version 2.1.3 follows very shortly after
:doc:`2.1.2 </releases/2-1-2-new-features-and-changes>` and is primarily a security
release. Refer to the :doc:`2.1.1 release notes </releases/2-1-1-new-features-and-changes>` for changes from 2.1 to 2.1.1
and :doc:`2.1.2 release notes </releases/2-1-2-new-features-and-changes>` for changes
from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2.

Security Fixes
--------------

-  `pfSense-SA-14_05.tcp <https://www.pfsense.org/security/advisories/pfSense-SA-14_05.tcp.asc>`__

   -  `FreeBSD-SA-14:08.tcp <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-14:08.tcp.asc>`__

-  `pfSense-SA-14_06.openssl <https://www.pfsense.org/security/advisories/pfSense-SA-14_06.openssl.asc>`__

   -  `FreeBSD-SA-14:09.openssl <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-14:09.openssl.asc>`__

Packages also had their own independent fixes and need updating. During
the firmware update process the packages will be reinstalled properly.
Otherwise, uninstall and then reinstall packages to ensure that the
latest version of the binaries is in use.

Although these security issues warrant updating as soon as possible,
they are of relatively minor impact to the average user. According to
the FreeBSD SA, the TCP flaw is mitigated by scrub in pf which is
enabled by default in pfSense. The OpenSSL flaw is not used by any
daemons in the pfSense base system and only certain packages make use of
the affected feature, so the impact there is also minimal.
