2.5.0 New Features and Changes
==============================

pfSenseÂ® software version 2.5.0 brings a major OS version upgrade, OpenSSL
upgrades, PHP and Python upgrades, and numerous bug fixes.

.. warning:: The original plan was to include a RESTCONF API in pfSense version
   2.5.0, which for security reasons would have required hardware AES-NI or
   equivalent support. Plans have since changed, and pfSense 2.5.0 does not
   contain the planned RESTCONF API, thus **pfSense version 2.5.0 WILL NOT
   require AES-NI**.

.. tip:: For those who have not yet updated to 2.4.4-p3 or 2.4.4, consult
   the :doc:`previous release notes <index>` and `blog posts for those releases
   <https://www.netgate.com/blog/category.html#releases>`__ to read all
   important information and warnings before proceeding.

Operating System / Architecture changes
---------------------------------------

* Base OS upgraded to FreeBSD **12.0-RELEASE-p10**
* OpenSSL upgraded to **1.1.1a-freebsd**
* PHP upgraded to **7.3** `#9365 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/9365>`__
* Python upgraded to **3.6** `#9360 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/9360>`__

Security / Errata
-----------------

* Deprecated the built-in relayd Load Balancer `#9386 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/9386>`__

  * ``relayd`` does not function with OpenSSL 1.1.x
  * The ``relayd`` FreeBSD port has been changed to require libressl -- There is no apparent sign of work to make it compatible with OpenSSL 1.1.x
  * The HAProxy package may be used in its place; It is a much more robust and more feature-complete load balancer and reverse proxy
  * For more information on implementing HAProxy, see :doc:`../packages/haproxy-package` and the `Hangout <https://www.netgate.com/resources/videos/server-load-balancing-on-pfsense-24.html>`_

.. warning:: See the `FreeBSD 12.0 Release Notes <https://www.freebsd.org/releases/12.0R/relnotes.html#drivers-network>`_
   for information on deprecated hardware drivers that may impact firewalls
   upgrading to pfSense version 2.5.0. Some of these were renamed or folded into
   other drivers, others have been removed, and more are slated for removal in
   FreeBSD 13 in the future.

Known Issues
------------

* During development of pfSense version 2.5.0, there is a significant chance
  that packages will be unstable until closer to the release. Most of this is
  due to OpenSSL changes. This will stabilize as development progresses.

* Added CA/Certificate renewal functionality `#9842 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/9842>`__

    * Improved configuration change descriptions as shown in the GUI and configuration history/backups
    * Miscellaneous style and code re-use improvements
    * Changed CA/Cert date calculations to use a more accurate method, which ensures accuracy on ARM past the 2038 date barrier `#9899 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/9899>`__

IPsec
-----

* Enabled the strongSwan PKCS#11 plugin `#6775 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/6775>`__
* Added support for ECDSA certificates to IPsec for IKE `#4991 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4991>`__
* Renamed IPsec "RSA" options to "Certificate" since both RSA and ECDSA certificates are now supported, and it is also easier for users to recognize `#9903 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/9903>`__
* Converted IPsec configuration code from ``ipsec.conf`` ``ipsec``/``stroke`` style to ``swanctl.conf`` ``swanctl``/``vici`` style `#9603 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/9603>`__

  * Split up much of the single large IPsec configuration function into multiple functions as appropriate.
  * Optimized code along the way, including reducing code duplication and finding ways to generalize functions to support future expansion.
  * For IKEv1 and IKEv2 with Split Connections enabled, P2 settings are properly respected for each individual P2, such as separate encryption algorithms `#6263 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/6263>`__

    * **N.B.:** In rare cases this may expose a previous misconfiguration which allowed a Phase 2 SA to connect with improper settings, for example if a required encryption algorithm was enabled on one P2 but not another.

  * New GUI option under **VPN > IPsec**, **Mobile Clients** tab to enable RADIUS Accounting which was previously on by default. This is now disabled by default as RADIUS accounting data will be sent for every tunnel, not only mobile clients, and if the accounting data fails to reach the RADIUS server, tunnels may be disconnected.
  * Additional developer & advanced user notes:

    * For those who may have scripts which touched files in ``/var/etc/ipsec``, note that the structure of this directory has changed to the new `swanctl layout <https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Swanctldirectory>`__.
    * Any usage of ``/usr/local/sbin/ipsec`` or the stroke plugin must also be changed to ``/usr/local/sbin/swanctl`` and VICI. Note that some commands have no direct equivalents, but the same or better information is available in other ways.
    * IPsec start/stop/reload functions now use ``/usr/local/sbin/strongswanrc``
    * IPsec-related functions were converged into ``ipsec.inc``, removed from ``vpn.inc``, and renamed from ``vpn_ipsec_<name>`` to ``ipsec_<name>``
  * Reworked how reauthentication and rekey behavior functions, giving more control to the user compared to previous options `#9983 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/9983>`__
* Reformatted ``status_ipsec.php`` to include more available information (rekey timer, encryption key size, IKE SPIs, ports) `#9979 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/9979>`__
* Added support for PKCS#11 authentication (e.g. hardware tokens such as Yubikey) for IPsec `#9878 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/9878>`__
* Fixed disabling an IPsec P1 entry with a VTI P2 when an interface assignment does not exist `#10190 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/10190>`__
