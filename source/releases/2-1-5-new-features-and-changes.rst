   network type alias

-  Encode the detail field of an alias entry before displaying its
   contents back to the user

   daemon settings, and GIF/GRE interfaces

   must not be defined on the secondary

   can press the button to execute

   section of the config is missing

-  Added filter.so to list of extensions loaded for filter_var()
   support.
-  The pfSense PHP module was setting the subnet mask of lo0 to /0,
   which could break some routes and cause other unintended routing side
   effects.
