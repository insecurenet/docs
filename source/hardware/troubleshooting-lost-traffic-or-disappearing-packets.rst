Troubleshooting Lost Traffic or Disappearing Packets
====================================================

If there are issues with traffic being lost, or packets that seem to
disappear or never show up (or leave) an interface, try disabling
Checksum Offloading as follows:

-  Navigate to **System > Advanced** on the **Networking** tab
-  Check **Disable hardware checksum offload** under the **Network
   Interfaces** header.
-  Click **Save**.

Then try to reproduce the problem.

.. note:: A reboot may be desired after applying this option, but it
   should not be necessary.

This has historically been an issue with Realtek NICs and in some
scenarios with Via Rhine NICs. Also, some specific Intel fxp chips, as
well as virtualized/emulated NICs in some hypervisors, especially those
that use VirtIO.

The problem may also manifest as a PPPoE connection that will establish
a login and bring up the interface, but will not pass traffic.
