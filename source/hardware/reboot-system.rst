Rebooting the Firewall
======================

A pfSenseÂ® firewall can be rebooted safely and returned to an operational
state using the page at **Diagnostics > Reboot System**.

From that page, click **Yes** to reboot the system.

Certain changes, such as configuration restoration, may work properly
without rebooting but it may be necessary to reboot in order to ensure
proper operation.
