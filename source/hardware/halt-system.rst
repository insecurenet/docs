Halting and Powering Off the Firewall
=====================================

A pfSenseÂ® firewall may be shut down safely at **Diagnostics > Halt
System**

On that page, click **Yes** to shut down the firewall.

The system power will also be turned off after the operating system has
been halted, if that feature is supported by the hardware.
