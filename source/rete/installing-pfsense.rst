Installing pfSense
==================

This article will guide through selecting an appropriate version of
pfSenseÂ® software, the initial pfSense installation, and related tasks.

.. tip:: If you purchased an official `Netgate appliance`_, check the reinstall
   guide in the appropriate `Security Gateway Manual`_.

Choose Installation Type
------------------------

To install pfSense, first a few decisions are necessary to pick which
type of installation will be performed.

Hardware considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When selecting hardware for a new build, carefully consider current and
future hardware requirements. These include:

-  64-bit Intel or AMD CPU (x86-64, amd64) on pfSense 2.4 and later
-  Must be able to boot from USB or optical drive and run the installer
   on pfSense 2.4 and later

64-bit or 32-bit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from version 2.4, pfSense supports 64-bit (amd64) exclusively
while 32-bit (i386) support remains with pfSense 2.3, which will receive
security updates for at least a year after pfSense 2.4.0-RELEASE.

The **amd64** platform works on current x86-64 hardware from Intel, AMD,
etc. If the hardware is capable of using a 64-bit operating system, then
run the **amd64** version.

Installer ISO, Memstick or Memstick Serial?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a Full Install is to be performed, there are three types of install
media that can be used to accomplish the task:

-  Optical disc image (ISO image, CD/DVD disc): Easy and familiar to
   many, if the target hardware has an optical drive it's a solid
   choice, especially if the BIOS will not boot from USB.
-  Memstick: Like the CD/DVD, but run from a USB thumb drive. Often
   faster than the CD/DVD. Many new devices do not have integrated
   optical drives, making this the current best recommendation.
-  Serial Memstick: Like the Memstick image, but runs using the serial
   console rather than VGA, for newer embedded systems.

Virtual Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtual Machines, with hypervisors such as VMware vSphere, Hyper-V, KVM,
Proxmox or Xen, should be installed using the ISO image. They can be
used to firewall completely inside a hypervisor host for other virtual
machines, or for edge filtering/routing tasks.

-  :doc:`pfSense on Proxmox </virtualization/virtualizing-pfsense-with-proxmox>`

Download pfSense
----------------

- Visit https://www.pfsense.org/download
- Pick the chosen **Version**, **Architecture**, and **Installer type**
- Download the SHA256 checksum file to verify the image later
- Pick a mirror and click the link on its row to download the image
  from there
- Wait for the download to complete

Verify the Downloaded Image
---------------------------

SHA256 checksum files are available, which are viewable in any plain text
editor. These SHA256 files can be used to verify the download completed
successfully, and that an official release is being used.

Hash calculation programs vary by operating system, some common examples
include:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Windows

      Use `HashTab`_ to compare the value against the provided hash. With
      HashTab installed, right click on the downloaded file to access the **File
      Hashes** tab containing the **SHA256** hash, among others.

      .. tip:: If a SHA256 hash is not displayed, right click in the hash view
         and click **Settings**, then check the box for **SHA256** and click
         **OK**.

      The generated SHA256 hash from HashTab can be compared with the contents
      of the provided checksum.

      .. note:: It is also possible to use the Linux ``sha256sum`` or ``md5sum``
         commands within Cygwin if the Cygwin command prompt is launched as an
         Admin user.

   .. tab:: Mac OSX

      Use the ``shasum`` or ``md5`` command line utilities to generate a hash of
      the downloaded file.

      Example:

      .. code-block:: none

         shasum -a 256 pfSense-CE-2.4.4-RELEASE-p3-amd64.iso.gz

      The generated SHA256 hash can be compared with the contents of the
      provided **.sha256** checksum.

   .. tab:: Linux

      Use the ``sha256sum`` or ``md5sum`` command line utilities to generate a
      hash of the downloaded file.

      .. code-block:: none

         sha256sum pfSense-CE-2.4.4-RELEASE-p3-amd64.iso.gz

      The generated SHA256 hash can be compared with the contents of the
      provided **.sha256** checksum.

   .. tab:: FreeBSD

      Use the ``sha256`` or ``md5`` command line utilities to generate a
      hash of the downloaded file.

      .. code-block:: none

         sha256 pfSense-CE-2.4.4-RELEASE-p3-amd64.iso.gz

      The generated SHA256 hash can be compared with the contents of the
      provided **.sha256** checksum.

Prepare Installation Media
--------------------------

The downloaded image must be written to target media before it can be
used. For a Full Install, this media is used to boot and install and
then will not be needed again. For Embedded, the target media is the
disk (CF/SD) that will contain the Operating System.

-  Write the installer ISO: If the *.iso* file was downloaded, it must
   be burned to a disc as an ISO image. See :doc:`Writing ISO Images
   </install/writing-iso-images>` for assistance.
-  Writing Memstick images: This task is covered with great
   detail in `Writing an OS Installation Image to Flash Media`_.

Connect to Serial Console
-------------------------

Before attempting to install or boot, if a serial-based image was used,
such as Memstick-Serial, connect to the serial console with a
appropriate serial cable and terminal options. See :doc:`Connecting to the
Serial Console </hardware/connecting-to-the-serial-console>` for specifics.

Performing a Full Install
-------------------------

Power on the target system and connect the install media: Place the CD
into the drive or plug the Memstick into a USB port. If the BIOS is set
to boot from CD/USB, pfSense will start.

For other boot issues, :doc:`Installation Troubleshooting </install/installation-troubleshooting>`.

As the operating system boots and pfSense starts, a wizard will start
and prompt to accept the copyright and distribution notice.

.. image:: /_static/install/screen_shot_2017-11-16_at_22.27.33.png
   :align: center

To start the installation select **OK** while **Install** option is
selected.

.. image:: /_static/install/screen_shot_2017-11-16_at_22.28.03.png
   :align: center

Next step is to select filesystem. By default UFS is selected. ZFS
support is currently experimental. Select **OK** to continue. This
option automatically configures the hard drive.

.. image:: /_static/install/screen_shot_2017-11-16_at_22.28.11.png
   :align: center

The following step allows **Keymap Selection**. Standard **US** is
default. Continue to the next step with **Select**.

.. image:: /_static/install/screen_shot_2017-11-16_at_22.28.08.png
   :align: center

The install will proceed, wiping the target disk and installing pfSense.
Copying files may take some time to finish.

.. image:: /_static/install/screen_shot_2017-11-16_at_22.28.13.png
   :align: center

It usually takes no longer than a couple of minutes.

.. image:: /_static/install/screen_shot_2017-11-16_at_22.28.17.png
   :align: center

After installation completion manual configuration options are offered,
select **No** to continue.

.. image:: /_static/install/screen_shot_2017-11-16_at_22.28.35.png
   :align: center

Now the system must reboot so that pfSense may start from the target
disk. Select *Reboot* and then press **Enter**. Be sure to remove the
disc or USB memstick so that the system will not attempt to boot from
there next time.

.. image:: /_static/install/screen_shot_2017-11-16_at_22.28.42.png
   :align: center

After the system reboots, pfSense will be running from the target disk.
The next step is to Assign Interfaces on the Console below.

Assign Interfaces on the Console
--------------------------------

The default configuration file on pfSense 2.3 has *em0* assigned as WAN,
and *em1* assigned as LAN. If the target hardware has *em0* and *em1*,
then the assignment prompt is skipped and the install will proceed as
usual. Several other common platforms such as our SG systems, APU, and
ALIX are also recognized and will have their interfaces assigned in the
expected order.

If the hardware platform cannot be identified, a list of network
interfaces and their MAC addresses that were located on the system will
appear, along with an indication of their link state if that is
supported by the network card. The link state is denoted by "(up)"
appearing after the MAC address if a link is detected on that interface.
The MAC (Media Access Control) address of a network card is a unique
identifier assigned to each card, and no two network cards should have
the same MAC address. After that, a prompt will be shown for VLAN
configuration.

VLANS
~~~~~

The option to assign VLANs is presented first. If VLANs are not
required, or they are not known, enter *No* here. VLANs are optional and
are only needed for advanced networking. VLAN-capable equipment is also
required if they are to be used. See :doc:`VLAN Trunking </interfaces/vlan-trunking>`
for details.

LAN, WAN, OPTx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first interface prompt is for the **WAN** interface. If the
interface is known, enter its name, such as *igb0* or *em0* and press
**Enter**. If the identity of the card is not known, see the next
section for the Auto Assign Procedure.

The second interface prompt is for the **LAN** interface. Enter the
appropriate interface, such as *igb1* or *em1*, and press **Enter**
again. If only the WAN interface is to be used, and no LAN, press
**Enter** without giving any other input.

Only one interface (WAN) is required to setup pfSense. If more
interfaces are available they may be assigned as LAN and OPTx
interfaces. The procedure is the same for additional interfaces: Enter
the appropriate interface name, then press **Enter**.

When there are no more interfaces to add, press **Enter**. The list of
assigned interfaces is displayed. If the mappings are correct, enter
*y*, otherwise enter *n* and repeat the assignment.

    NOTE: If only one NIC is assigned (WAN), This is called Appliance
    Mode. In this mode, pfSense will move the GUI anti-lockout rule to
    the WAN interface so the firewall may be accessed from there. The
    usual routing functions would not be active since there is no
    "internal" interface. This type of configuration is useful for VPN
    appliances, DNS servers, etc.

Auto Assign Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For automatic interface assignment, first unplug all network cables from
the system, then type *a* and press **Enter**. Now plug a network cable
into the interface that should connect to the WAN, and press **Enter**.
If all went well, pfSense should know now which interface to use for the
WAN. The same process may be repeated for the LAN, and any optional
interfaces that will be needed. If a message is displayed such as No
link-up detected, see :doc:`Installation Troubleshooting </install/installation-troubleshooting>` for more information
on sorting out network card identities.

pfSense Default Configuration
-----------------------------

After installation and interface assignment, pfSense has the following
default configuration:

-  WAN is configured as an IPv4 DHCP client.
-  WAN is configured as an IPv6 DHCP client and will request a prefix
   delegation.
-  LAN is configured with a static IPv4 address of **192.168.1.1/24**.
-  LAN is configured to use a delegated IPv6 address/prefix obtained by
   WAN (Track IPv6) if one is available.
-  All incoming connections to WAN are *blocked*.
-  All outgoing connections from LAN are *allowed*.
-  NAT is performed on IPv4 traffic leaving WAN from the LAN subnet
-  The firewall will act as an IPv4 :doc:`DHCP Server </dhcp/dhcp-server>`
-  The firewall will act as an IPv6 :doc:`DHCPv6 Server </dhcp/dhcpv6-server>` if
   a prefix delegation was obtained on WAN, and also enables SLAAC
-  The :doc:`DNS Resolver </dns/unbound-dns-resolver>` is enabled so the
   firewall can accept and respond to DNS queries.
-  SSH is disabled.
-  WebGUI is running on port 443 using HTTPS.
-  Default credentials are set to a username of **admin** with password
   **pfsense**.

Connect to the GUI
------------------

After installation and assignment, a shell menu is presented on the
console with a number of options. pfSense now is ready to be accessed
via the network, either on the LAN interface (if one is assigned), or on
the WAN interface in a single interface deployment.
