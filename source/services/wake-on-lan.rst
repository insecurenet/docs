Using Wake on LAN
=================

The `Wake on LAN`_ (WoL) service, accessed through the pfSenseÂ®
webGUI at **Services > Wake on LAN**, can send a "magic packet"
to a workstation on a locally connected network which will
power on a workstation if it is configured properly.

To send a WoL magic packet, pick the **Interface**, enter a **MAC
address**, and click **Send**.

A list of WoL clients may also be managed for later use. All
clients in the WoL list may be awoken at once by clicking
|fa-power-off| above the list.
