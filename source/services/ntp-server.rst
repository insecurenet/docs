NTP Server
==========

The NTP Daemon (`ntpd`_), which can be configured at **Services > NTP**, allows
pfSenseÂ® software to act as a Network Time Protocol server for a network, and
also keeps the clock in sync against remote NTP servers as an NTP client itself.

.. note:: Before enabling this service, ensure that the router's clock keeps
   fairly accurate time.

By default, the NTP server will bind to and act as an NTP server on all
available IP addresses. This may be restricted using the **Interface(s)**
selection on **Services > NTP**.

.. warning:: This service should not be exposed publicly. Ensure inbound rules
   on WANs do not allow connections from the Internet to reach the NTP server on
   the firewall.

GPS Time Source
---------------

If a serial GPS is present, it may be selected and used as a time source.
Currently only NMEA format GPS output is used, other modes may work but require
additional testing/hardware availability.
