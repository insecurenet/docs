Accessing the Firewall Filesystem with SCP
==========================================

Files may be transferred to and from a pfSenseÂ® firewall with ``scp``,
which is part of the functionality that comes with having ssh access
enabled (See :doc:`/usermanager/granting-users-access-to-ssh`).

When connecting with an scp client such as from a FreeBSD/Linux
command line, with WinSCP, FileZilla, or even a *fish* URL in Konquerer,
the **root** user must be utilized. The **root** user has the same
password as the **admin** user but it is not locked into the menu for
its shell.

An example: Logged into a FreeBSD machine, I want to get a copy of a
file in /tmp::

  myuser@somebox:~/$ scp root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/lan-traffic.rrd-4h.png .

If ``scp`` is failing with the error **Illegal option -t** make sure to
use the **root** account, as mentioned above.
