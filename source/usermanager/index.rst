pfSenseÂ® software can utilize multiple user accounts to grant different types
of access to various functions of the firewall. These can range from access
to services such as captive portal all the way up to being a full
administrator account.

Users can be managed locally on the firewall or pfSense software can utilize
RADIUS and LDAP authentication sources.
