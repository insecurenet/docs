Using IPv6 with a Tunnel Broker
===============================

These instructions are adapted from the original document,
http://iserv.nl/files/pfsense/ipv6/

This page details the process of getting IPv6 support
with a Tunnel Broker in pfSenseÂ® software version 2.3.3 or above
working. This guide can also work on older versions, but there
may be minor differences in option locations or names.

Pitfalls
--------

If the installation of pfSense software was upgraded from 2.0.x or
before to 2.1 or above, IPv6 support must be enabled by navigating to
**System > Advanced** on the **Networking** tab, and checking **Allow
IPv6**. New 2.1 or above installs have this option enabled by default.

ICMP is required for IPv6 to work. If a firewall is in place on clients,
make sure that ICMP over IPv6 is allowed.

If using a tunnel broker account, be sure to pick a provider as close to
the pfSense firewall as possible. Latency can be a killer and will creep
up in strange ways.

Building a Tunnel
-----------------

Sign Up
~~~~~~~

This article assumes that an account has already been registered with
`Hurricane Electric <http://www.tunnelbroker.net>`__ or some other
broker. After registering an account and getting the first /64 or /48
IPv6 block assigned, the gif tunnel may be configured on pfSense
software.

Enable ICMP
~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't forget to enable ICMP on the WAN interface, if ICMP is blocked the
tunnelbroker will not allow a tunnel to be configured. The source IP
address on this rule could be limited to the remote endpoint IP of the
gif tunnel, or *any*. It could allow for all icmp or just echoreq.

Create GIF Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now navigate to the assign gif interfaces screen on pfSense where the
address information from Hurricane Electric or other may be entered.
**Interfaces > (Assignments)**, **GIF** tab.

-  The HE or other **Server IPv4 address** goes into the **gif remote
   address**
-  The HE or other **Client IPv6 address** goes into the **gif tunnel
   local address**
-  The HE or other **Server IPv6 address** goes into the **gif tunnel
   remote address**

The prefix length should be set to *64*. After pfSense 2.1.1, the prefix
length chosen for the IPv6 tunnel will be ignored and set to a prefix
length of *128* On the interface assignments the interface will show a
prefix length of *128*.

Enter a **Description** and click **Save**.

Note: If a tunnel is being attached to a dynamic WAN IP, look at **Keep
the Tunnel Endpoint Up-To-Date** later in this document.

Assign GIF Interface
--------------------

Click |fa-plus| on **Interfaces > (Assignments)** and choose the GIF interface
to be used for an OPT interface. In this example, the OPT interface has
been renamed *HENETv6*. Click **Save** and **Apply Changes** if they
appear.

Configure OPT Interface
-----------------------

With the OPT interface assigned, the OPT interface may be enabled from
the **Interfaces** menu. Keep **IPv6 Configuration Type** set to *None*.

MTU Values
~~~~~~~~~~

If the base interface for this IPv6 connection is a DSL line or other
line with a lower MTU, the MTU may need adjusted here and on the other
end to accommodate the lower value. On tunnelbroker.net, login to the
account and edit the tunnel. In the **Advanced options**, move the
**MTU** slider (1) until the **MTU** reads **1452** (2).

Set Gateway
-----------

A dynamic gateway entry will be automatically created for the tunnel.
Now edit it and set the **Default Gateway** option, keeping the gateway
field set to *dynamic*.

.. image:: /_static/interfaces/ipv6_howto_gateway_settings.png
   :align: center

If all of the settings were entered correctly and the tunnel broker is
working, the gateway will now be listed as online

Set Up LAN for IPv6
-------------------

The LAN interface may be configured for static IPv6 network. The network
used for IPv6 addressing on the LAN Interface is an address in the
**Routed /64 or /48** subnet assigned by the tunnel broker. HE.net gives
one automatically. It is important to note that the **Routed /64 or
/48** range is *different* from the **Tunnel /64**!

The example below uses *::1* as that is the easiest by far. Anything in
the routed subnet works.

-  The **Routed /64 or /48** is the basis for the **IPv6 Address** field

Set Up DHCPv6 and RA
--------------------

Most configurations will want the computers on the LAN to automatically
pick up the IPv6 Address instead of assiging it manually. To set this
up, navigate to **Services > DHCPv6 Server &RA**.

On the Router Advertisements tab, there is a mode option where different
types of router advertisement behavior may be chosen. Either unmanaged
(advertise only), managed (dhcp6 only) or assisted (use stateless
address with dhcp for the dns). See :doc:`Router Advertisements </routing/configuring-ipv6-router-advertisements>`
and :doc:`DHCPv6 Server </dhcp/dhcpv6-server>` for more details.

Add a rule to let IPv6 out
--------------------------

Now navigate to **Firewall > Rules**, **LAN** tab, and add a rule to
pass IPv6 traffic out from LAN to any, just like the rule for IPv4.

Without an IPv6 allow rule, no traffic will get out.

Try it out!
-----------

At this point a LAN client should be able to pick up an IPv6 Address and
find the pfSense firewall as it is now advertising itself on the LAN.
This can be checked with http://test-ipv6.com if the IPv6 connection is
successfully detected.

Keep the Tunnel Endpoint Up-To-Date
-----------------------------------

If the WAN connecting the tunnel has a dynamic IP address, the *HE.net
Tunnelbroker* DynDNS type may be used to update it when the WAN IP
address changes.

To set that up:

-  Navigate to **Services > Dynamic DNS**
-  Click |fa-plus|
-  Set the **Type** to *HE.net Tunnelbroker*
-  Select the proper **Interface**
-  For **Hostname** enter the numeric **Tunnel ID** from he.net
-  Enter the **Username**
-  Enter **Password** OR **Update Key** from the **Advanced** tab of the
   tunnel's settings on tunnelbroker.net. Older accounts may not have an
   **Update Key** and may use only the password.
-  Enter a **Description** if desired
-  Click **Save**
