Automatic NAT Rules Generation
==============================

In a default single WAN connection configuration, pfSenseÂ® software
automatically generates NAT rules for every directly connected
interface and any networks reachable through internal gateways defined
via :doc:`Static Routes </routing/static-routes>`. These NAT rules will
perform NAT on outbound traffic to translate the source address of
Internet-bound traffic to the WAN IP.

In a default multi-WAN configuration, pfSense software automatically
generates NAT rules to NAT any internal subnet leaving any interface
with a gateway.

The Outbound NAT Configuration may be changed by visiting **Firewall >
NAT** on the **Outbound** tab.

With :doc:`Manual Outbound NAT </nat/advanced-outbound-nat>`,
this automatic rule generation may be disabled and custom outbound NAT
rules may be defined manually. When switching to **Manual Outbound NAT**
without any rules defined, a set of rules is created automatically that
is the equivalent of the rules currently in use by **Automatic Outbound
NAT**.
