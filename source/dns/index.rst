DNS
***

DNS, or Domain Name System, is the mechanism by which a network device resolves
a name like ``www.example.com`` to an IP address such as ``198.51.100.25``, or
vice versa. Clients must have functional DNS if they are to reach other devices
such as servers using their hostnames or fully qualified domain names.

DNS Resolver/Forwarder
''''''''''''''''''''''

These topics cover using pfSenseÂ® software as a caching DNS resolver or forwarder, which
handles DNS requests from local clients. When acting as a resolver or forwarder,
pfSense software will performs DNS resolution or hand off queries to an upstream DNS
forwarding server.

Dynamic DNS
'''''''''''

Dynamic DNS will update an external DNS server with an interface IP address when
it changes. This enables a firewall with a dynamic WAN such as DHCP or PPPoE to
host public services even when its IP address changes periodically.
