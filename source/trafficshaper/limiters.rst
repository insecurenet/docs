Using Limiters to Restrict Bandwidth Usage
==========================================

The **Limiters** feature sets up `dummynet(4)`_ pipes. Dummynet was designed to
simulate any kind of network connection. Various types of connections can be
simulated such as Dialup, T1, a T1 run through a microwave oven, or a satellite
connection to the Moon. A side effect of being able to simulate any type of
network connection is that they can also be used to limit the amount of
bandwidth a host or group of hosts have access to.

Both the packet shaper and limiters can be used at the same time so traffic can
be shaped as a whole, and also limit certain traffic to a certain amount of
bandwidth.

There are 2 basic steps to setting up a limiter to control bandwidth:

#. Setup the limiters
#. Assign traffic to those limiters

Setup Limiters
--------------

Limiters are setup by creating them under **Firewall > Traffic Shaper**, on the
**Limiters** tab.

One pipe may be used for both inbound and outbound traffic, but that would be
simulating a `half-duplex connection
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_duplex#Half-duplex>`__.

The recommended method is to create 2 pipes, one for inbound traffic and one for
outbound traffic. The direction is from the perspective of the interface. If
using limiters on LAN, the inbound queue is upload and the outbound queue is
download. Name the pipes so that they are easy to distinguish and identify, such
as ``InLimitLan`` and ``OutLimitLan``, or ``LAN_Up`` and ``LAN_Down``

Dynamic queue creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dummynet pipes have a feature called dynamic queue creation which allows unique
queues based on the uniqueness of a connections source protocol, IP address,
source port, destination address or destination port. They can also be used in
combination. pfSenseÂ® software currently only allows setting the source address
or the destination address as the mask. This means each host behind the firewall,
or subnet, will have its own set of pipes so that each node is restricted to using
a certain amount of bandwidth. To do this, give the *In* pipe a **Source
Address** mask, so that each host sending packets gets it's own dynamic pipe for
uploading. Give the *Out* pipe a destination address mask, so that each host
receiving packets gets it's own dynamic pipe for downloading.

Assign Traffic
--------------

The next step is to assign traffic to the limiter by setting the **In/Out**
option in a firewall rule. Remember that **in** and **out** are from the
*perspective of that interface* on the firewall. When choosing limiters on the
LAN interface, **out** is download (traffic from the LAN NIC out to the LAN) and
**in** is upload (traffic from the LAN into the LAN NIC).

Creating the limiters does not do anything on its own, they **must** be assigned
on a firewall rule.

Limiter Status
--------------

Bandwidth usage and other limiter information is available under **Diagnostics >
Limiter Info**.

Captive Portal Notes
--------------------

Captive portal can automatically setup its own pipes for each logged in user, no
need to set this up manually. Take a look at Captive Portal page to set this up.

Using Limiters for Bandwidth Guarantees
---------------------------------------

To guarantee a certain amount of minimum bandwidth be available to a pipe, rather than capping bandwidth, use limiters to cap the other "Remaining" bandwidth usage below the total available. Then set aside that bandwidth for a "Guaranteed" Tier. 

#. Guaranteed Tier Upload Bandwidth
#. Guaranteed Tier Download Bandwidth
#. Remaining Tier Upload Bandwidth (Total minus Guaranteed)
#. Remaining Tier Download Bandwidth (Total minus Guaranteed)

The Mask must be **none** for these to work properly, otherwise it
cannot enforce a total limit.

For example, if the WAN has 8Mb down and 2Mb up, to guarantee 512 Kb/s for service X
create queues sized like so:

#. 512 Kb/s
#. 512 Kb/s
#. 1536 Kb/s
#. 7680 Kb/s

Then direct the guaranteed service traffic into the first two limiters,
and everything else into the "Remaining" limiters.

Limiters on Bridges
-------------------

When using limiters on bridges, the bridge interface must be assigned and it
must contain the IP address for the bridge. Place the limiters on the member
interfaces.

Known limitations
-----------------

-  On pfSense 2.2 and 2.3, limiters cannot be used on firewall rules residing on
   interfaces where NAT applies. This limits their use to LAN-type interfaces
   only, and not WANs, in most circumstances. This has been fixed on pfSense
   2.4. `Bug #4326`_.

Troubleshooting

Display Pipes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visit **Diagnostics > Limiter Info** in the GUI, and it will show the output
of::

  ipfw pipe show

Which lists all of the pipes currently configured on the system, and related
information about their status.
