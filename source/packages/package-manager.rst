Using the Package Manager
=========================

The **Package Manager** is used to install and maintain packages on a
pfSenseÂ® firewall. Packages are listed with a **Name**, **Category**,
**Version**, and a **Description** of what the package is or does.

.. seealso:: A list of available packages with more information on each is
   available on the :doc:`package-list` page.

Installing New Packages
-----------------------

The **Available Packages** tab displays only those packages which are available
to install on a given platform and pfSense software version. For example, a full
install has all packages available, while a NanoBSD/embedded install only has
packages which have been tested and known to work on that platform. Categories
are displayed as additional sub-tabs to make browsing specific types of packages
simpler.

To install a package, find it in the list and click |fa-plus| **Install** at the
end of its row. Then click |fa-check| **Confirm** to confirm the installation
action.

During installation, the **Package Installer** tab will appear and the
installation progress is displayed graphically along with a log of activity.

Manage Installed Packages
-------------------------

The **Installed Packages** tab lists packages which are currently present on the
firewall. To remove a package, click |fa-trash| at the end of its row. To
reinstall a package, click |fa-retweet|.

If a package has an available upgrade, click |fa-refresh|, then click |fa-check|
**Confirm** to confirm the installation action and upgrade it to the latest
version
