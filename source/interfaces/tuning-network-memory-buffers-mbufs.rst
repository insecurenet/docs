Tuning Network Memory Buffers (mbufs)
=====================================

From the FreeBSD `MBUF(9) man page`_:

    An mbuf is a basic unit of memory management in the kernel IPC
    subsystem. Network packets and socket buffers are stored in mbufs. A
    network packet may span multiple mbufs arranged into a mbuf chain
    (linked list), which allows adding or trimming network headers with
    little overhead.

    An mbuf consists of a variable-sized header and a small internal
    buffer for data.

For more details, read `Network Buffer Allocation in the FreeBSD Operating
System [May 2004]`_.

If there are concerns about mbuf usage on a firewall, see
:doc:`/hardware/tuning-and-troubleshooting-network-cards`.
