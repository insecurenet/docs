Controlling IPv6 or IPv4 Preference
===================================

By default, the firewall itself will prefer IPv6 if is is configured and
has a default route. It is possible to control whether services on the
firewall itself will prefer IPv4 over IPv6. This may need to be changed
in order to run a firmware upgrade or manage packages if for some reason
the IPv6 routing is not functional but the system believes it is up and
working.

In pfSenseÂ® software version 2.2, this is controlled under **System >
Advanced** on the **Networking** tab. Check **Prefer IPv4 over IPv6**,
then click **Save**.

On pfSense software version2.1.x, there is no option in the GUI. It can
still be changed at the shell (or with a shellcmd tag.)

To prefer IPv4::

  env ip6addrctl_enable="yes" ip6addrctl_policy="prefer_ipv4" /etc/rc.d/ip6addrctl start

To prefer IPv6 again::

  ip6addrctl flush
