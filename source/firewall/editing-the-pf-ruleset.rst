Editing the pf ruleset
======================

The PF rules generated by the pfSenseÂ® firewall configuration may be found in
/tmp/rules.debug. However that file **cannot** be edited to make
persistent changes - it will be overwritten.

There is virtually never a need to manually edit the rules generated by
the GUI. In most cases if it appears to be necessary, something is being
configured incorrectly. Between the typical interface rules and floating
rules there are few cases

If the generated rules truly must be edited, then editing
/etc/inc/filter.inc which generates the ruleset is necessary.
