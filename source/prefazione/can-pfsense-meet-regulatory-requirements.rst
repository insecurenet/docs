Can pfSense meet regulatory requirements
========================================

Prospective pfSenseÂ® users commonly inquire about the ability to meet
security requirements applicable to their specific environments. Some of
those include PCI, SOX, GLBA, HIPAA, amongst numerous other similar
regulations for publicly traded companies, financial institutions,
healthcare institutions, and others.

There are numerous companies in many regulated industries using pfSense
that pass their audits with no problems, including all of the
aforementioned regulations/standards amongst others. However it's
important to keep in mind that a firewall is a small portion of the
security infrastructure, and those regulations are more about policies,
procedures, and configuration than the actual products being used.

So yes, pfSense *can* meet regulatory requirements, but that is
dependent on configuration, policies, procedures, amongst other things -
there is no compliance silver bullet. There may be circumstances
specific to one company that make another product a better fit for
compliance (or other) reasons, but that's true of all commercial and
open source solutions, there is no one product that is a perfect fit for
everyone.
