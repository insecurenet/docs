Managing Lists of Items in the GUI
==================================

The pfSenseÂ® WebGUI has a common set of icons which are used for managing lists
and collections of objects throughout the firewall. Not every icon is used in
every page, but their meanings are consistent based on the context in which they
are seen. Examples of such lists include firewall rules, NAT rules, IPsec,
OpenVPN, and certificates.

:|fa-plus|: Add a new item to a list
:|fa-level-up|: Add an item to the beginning of a list
:|fa-level-down|: Add an item to the end of a list
:|fa-pencil|: Edit an existing item
:|fa-clone|: Copy an item (create a new item based on the selected item)
:|fa-ban|: Disable an active item
:|fa-cso|: Enable a disabled item
:|fa-trash|: Delete an item
:|fa-anchor|: Used for moving entries after selecting one or more items. Click
  to move the selected items above this row. Shift-click to move the selected
  items below this row.

.. tip:: To determine which action an icon will perform, hover over the icon
   with the mouse pointer and a tooltip will display a short description of the
   icon's purpose.
