Using the VMware Appliance
==========================

The pre-built VMware Appliance, formerly known as the pfSense® Virtual Security
Gateway Appliance for VMware®, has been discontinued. To run pfSense under
VMware ESXi or Workstation, install it from an ``.iso`` image and then install
the ``open-vm-tools`` package. This is covered in
:doc:`/virtualization/virtualizing-pfsense-with-vmware-vsphere-esxi`
