Virtualizing pfSense with VMware vSphere / ESXi
===============================================

This article is about building a pfSenseÂ® virtual machine on vSphere /
ESXi. Article explains how to install any major pfSense software
version on VMware vSphere versions 5.x and 6.x. The article does not
cover how to install vSphere or how to configure pfSense software to
do any of the many amazing things it can. A basic, working, pfSense 
virtual machine will exist by the end of this document.

.. note:: If the pfSense firewall will be running as a perimeter
   firewall for an organization and the "attack surface" should be
   minimized, many will say it is preferable to run it unvirtualized on
   stand-alone hardware. That is a decision for the user and/or
   organization to make, however. Now back to the topic.*

We're going to start at the point where we have a vanilla ESXi install
and have connected to it using the vSphere client. If other VMs are
already running on ESXi, then it is not likely necessary to follow the
networking steps too closely. However, we recommend skimming through it
to see what is suggested before building the pfSense virtual machine
part.

Assumptions
-----------

-  vSphere host is up and running
-  The reader has an understanding of network addressing
-  You have already uploaded pfSense installation .iso to the datastore.

Installing pfSense Software on vSphere 6.x using vSphere web client
===================================================================

The following steps include the necessary vSphere web client
configuration required to get pfSense VM running. After getting to the
pfSense setup step, switch to the guide for vSphere client below.

Basic vSphere web client networking setup
-----------------------------------------

Before creating a new VM in vSphere web client, you will need to create
two virtual switches and two port groups. We will first create Virtual
switches for WAN and LAN and after that two port groups for the WAN and
LAN.

From the vSphere web client navigator, click on Networking and then
click on Virtual switches tab. From there, click on "Add a new standard
virtual switch".

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/vsphereaddswitch1.png
   :align: center

Add two Virtual switches, one for WAN and another for LAN. For uplink
select two separate available ports.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/vsphereaddswitch2.png
   :align: center

Creating port groups
--------------------

After creating Virtual switches, click on Port groups tab. On the Port
groups tab click on "Add port group". Add WAN and LAN port groups, each
using WAN and LAN switches respectively.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/vsphereaddport1.png
   :align: center

Creating a pfSense VM
---------------------

Now that the networking part is done, we continue to create a virtual machine.
From the dashboard click on "Create/Register VM". On the first wizard screen
select "Create a new virtual machine".

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/vsphereweb1.png
   :align: center

On the second page of the wizard, enter a name for your VM and select
correct Guest OS version.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/vsphereweb2.png
   :align: center

On the third page of the wizard, select the datastore where you want
to keep your pfSense VM.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/vsphereweb3.png
   :align: center

On wizard page four, add another Network Adapter and select the WAN
and LAN virtual switches for each of the network adapters. Modify
other virtual machine settings to your liking. For best performance,
we recommend using VMXNET 3 type of adapters instead of E1000.
However, with VMXNET 3 interfaces type you will have to manually
assign interfaces with the first boot. For the purpose of this guide
we used E1000 adapter type.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/vsphereweb4.png
   :align: center

On the final wizard screen confirm the settings and click finish.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/vsphereweb5.png
   :align: center

pfSense software installation
-----------------------------

Once the pfSense virtual machine is created, under vSphere web client
navigator click on "Virtual Machines" and select your newly created VM.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/prepower.png
   :align: center

Power on the virtual machine.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/poweredon.png
   :align: center

On the next screen, press "I" to invoke installer mode.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/selectvirtual.png.png
   :align: center

After the pfSense installer boots you will be greeted by the setup
wizard. Select "Accept these settings"

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/pfsensetup.png
   :align: center

On the following screen choose "Quick/Easy Install" after which
installation starts.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/screen_shot_2017-07-25_at_17.49.32.png
   :align: center

When prompted, select "Standard Kernel".

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/screen_shot_2017-07-25_at_17.50.11.png
   :align: center

After that installation completes and pfSense software boots up for the
first time.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/screen_shot_2017-07-25_at_17.57.04.png
   :align: center

Installing Open-VM-Tools
------------------------

Once the pfSense installation is complete, upon first boot install the
Open-VM-Tools. Reboot is not necessary afterwards, however make sure the
Open-VM-Tools service is running under Status > Services.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/screen_shot_2017-07-25_at_18.09.41.png
   :align: center

Congratulations, you have successfully completed pfSense installation
on ESXi!

Installing pfSense Software on vSphere 5.x using vSphere client
===============================================================

Basic vSphere Networking
------------------------

About vmnics, vSwitches, management and virtual machine networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the vSphere client the network diagram for an ESXi host may be viewed
by clicking **Networking** on the **Configuration** tab:

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_2_1a.png
   :align: center

After ESXi was installed, before it was possible to connect to it with
the vSphere client, a physical network adapter (a "vmnic" in the
diagram) had to be nominated to be the ESXi Management Network. An IP
address also had to be assigned to Management Network interface on the
the ESXi host, either through DHCP or manually through the console.

The network diagram above shows that the Management Network was assigned
to vmnic0 and it has an IP address of *192.168.111.30*.
(192.168.111.0/24 is my home LAN. Others will most likely be different.)
Whatever subnet was chosen, the VMkernel Port in the diagram is the
Management Network and that's what the vSphere client is now talking to.

ESXi will name the first physical NIC it finds ``vmnic0``. If vmnic0
is the management interface, ESXi will have automatically attached a
virtual switch, ``vSwitch0``, to that interface.

In addition to the VMkernel port, ESXi will also attach a Virtual
Machine Port Group to the vSwitch. In the diagram above it's labeled as
"Virtual Machine Network". The VM Port group is where Virtual Machines
can be attached to this virtual network.

In summary, in the above diagram, vSwitch0 has both a VM Port Group
(Virtual Machine Network) and a VMkernel Port (Management Network)
attached.

Creating the LAN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a small network it is quite common to use the Virtual Machine Port
Group on vSwitch0 to provide the LAN interface for the pfSense firewall.
That allows access to the LAN side of the pfSense virtual machine and to
manage the ESXi host with the vSphere client from a single PC. Of course,
the virtual machine (e.g., the pfSense firewall) and the ESXi management
interface must have different IP addresses.

*COMMENT: I must say here that I always separate the ESXi Management
network from other networks. I won't go into the detail but there are
some very good reasons for doing this. Without using VLANs, though,
separation would mean that an additional NIC on the ESXi host would be
dedicated only for ESXi management. What's more, another NIC would be
required in the vSphere client PC to connect to the management NIC on
the ESXi host. To follow that path and enough NICs are available, simply
delete the Virtual Machine Port Group by clicking the Properties link
above **vmnic0**, highlight the VM Port Group and click Remove.*

Assuming there are only two NICs in the ESXi host, rename the VM Port
Group from "Virtual Machine Network" to something a bit more meaningful.
Click the **Properties...** link for vmnic0:

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_2_1c.png
   :align: center

Highlight the Virtual Machine Network and click the Edit button.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_2_1b.png
   :align: center

Change the **Network label** to "LAN" and click OK then Close.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_2_2a.png
   :align: center

This makes life a little easier when we assign virtual network
interfaces to the pfSense instance.

Creating the WAN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we're not going to deal with VLANs here, a second physical NIC is
required in the ESXi host. This will be the WAN interface.

*HINT: If multiple physical interfaces are available in the ESXi host,
it can be a bit of a struggle to work out which one has been identified
as vmnic1, vmnic2 and so on. If the MAC address of each NIC is noted
down along with the slot it occupied when it was installed in the
machine, look at the Network Adapters screen under the Configuration tab
to match up the MAC addresses (new to ESXi 5). However, having that
foresight is rare, so lacking that information the easiest way to match
physical NICs to vmnics is to plug a PC or switch into them, one at a
time. The speed and duplex on the Networking or Network Adapters screens
should change as the interface comes up. Because VMware didn't provide a
Refresh link on the Network Adapters screen, refresh by navigating to
somewhere else then going back.*

Now we need to link the second physical NIC (**vmnic1**), to a new
vSwitch. Click the Add Networking link at the top right of the
Networking screen and the following dialog will appear.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_2_3a.png
   :align: center

We are adding a Virtual Machine network so select that option and
click Next.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_2_4a.png
   :align: center

We want this NIC to be attached to a new vSwitch so select Create a
virtual switch and check vmnic1. Click Next.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_2_5a.png
   :align: center

As we did with the LAN, let's give this VM Port Group a more
meaningful name of "WAN". Click Next.

The next dialog simply confirms that everything looks OK. Click Finish.

The networking diagram should now look like this:

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_2_6a.png
   :align: center

Now we can configure a new virtual machine on which pfSense software
will be installed.

Configuring the Virtual Machine
-------------------------------

Right click the ESXi host in the left pane of the vSphere client and
select **New virtual machine...**

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-1a.png
   :align: center

In the **Configuration** window, I always like to take the **Custom**
option. (I've never really trusted what someone else thinks is
"typical"). Click **Next**

Name and Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-2a.png
   :align: center

In the Name and Location window, let's give the virtual machine a
meaningful name like "pfSense" and click **Next**

Storage
~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-3a.png
   :align: center

Now we need to decide where disk storage will be allocated to hold the
configuration and operating files for the virtual machine. (This is
not necessarily the same location as the file system for pfSense
software, as shown later.) There are two datastores on this server â a 
small 80GB drive on which ESXi is installed and a 500GB disc which is
for virtual machine storage. Highlight a datastore from the list and
click **Next**.

Virtual Machine Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-4a.png
   :align: center

Here is where the virtual machine version to use for the pfSense
installation is configured in ESXi. Note the warning above. Select
version 8 and click **Next**.

Guest operating System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-5a.png
   :align: center

pfSense software is built on the FreeBSD operating system, not Linux.
Select **Other** and chose **FreeBSD (32-bit)** or **FreeBSD (64-bit)**.

Make sure the hardware is capable of running 64-bit virtual machines, which it
must be to run ESXi, and download the pfSense ISO image for installation,
choosing the *amd64* architecture.

Click **Next**.

CPUs
~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-6a.png
   :align: center

To get started, a single-socket, single-core configuration will do for
now. This and other virtual machine settings can always be changed
later if needed. Click **Next**

Memory
~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-7a.png
   :align: center

Depending on the number and type of packages that will be installed on
the pfSense software, a basic pfSense VM should run comfortably in
512MB of RAM. A lot of simple, non-virtual installations run on old PCs
with 256MB and less, so long as swap space is available on the disk.
Given the low cost of RAM these days, allocating less than 512MB would
not be advised.

If physical RAM on the ESX host is limited - perhaps because lots of
other virtual machines will be running - the allocation on the pfSense
VM could be reduced to, say, 384MB. If lots of memory-hungry packages
will be run, give it more.

To change the memory allocation to one of the sizes shown on the scale
of the memory "thermometer", click that value on the scale. Click **Next**

Network
~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-8a.png
   :align: center

Remember that the two virtual networks were renamed to LAN and WAN.
This is where we attach those networks to the pfSense virtual machine.

Select the number of virtual NICs for use by the pfSense VM. In this case it
will be *2*. Now, using the drop-down lists assign **NIC 1** on the
virtual machine to the WAN network. Assign NIC 2 to LAN. (This is why
the virtual machine port groups were given these names â they are much
easier to recognize.)

.. note:: On pfSense software version 2.2 and later, the choices in the
   default configuration are *em0* for WAN and *em1* for LAN, so WAN should be
   assigned to NIC 1. This may differ from the screenshots shown here.
   The interface assignment prompt will no longer appear for hosts
   using *em* NICs, so be careful not to attach a LAN to *em0*!

Note that for each NIC an **Adapter** type may also be selected.
Different adapter types may give better or worse performance (and some
may not work at all) but that is beyond the scope of this document. To
get started, choose the dependable **E1000** type for each adapter. Make
sure that **Connect at Power On** is checked and click **Next**.

SCSI Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-9a.png
   :align: center

An emulation of an LSI Logic SCSI controller is offered on this system
and, as far as I know, the recommendation is based on the operating
system of the virtual machine intend to be installed. Accept the
default and click **Next**.

Select a Disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-10a.png
   :align: center

This is where the operating system will build its file system.

Choose **Create a new virtual disk** and click **Next**.

Create a Disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-11a.png
   :align: center

In this example, the virtual disk was given a capacity of *8GB* but
there is quite a lot to spare and *8GB* isn't really that much these
days.

Under **Location,** keep the virtual machine's hard disk with the
virtual machine itself. Read the help to learn more about this set of
options, if desired.

Click **Next**.

Advanced Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-12a.png
   :align: center

Like it says â these options do not normally need to be changed.
**Next.**

Ready to Complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-13a.png
   :align: center

Now a summary of what has been configured so far for this virtual
machine is displayed.

Before finishing, check the box **Edit virtual machine settings before
completion**. The label on the **Finish** button will change to
**Continue**. This will allow the boot CD from which the pfSense 
software will be installed to be configured. Click **Continue.**

Editing the Virtual Machine's Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_3-14b.png
   :align: center

In the Virtual Machine Properties dialog select the **Hardware** tab
and then the line **New CD/DVD (Adding)** line. In the right-hand pane
choose the location of the CD/DVD drive:

-  **Host Device**

If a CD/DVD drive is available in the ESXi host, select the CD/DVD drive
and check **Connect at power on**. This change allows pfSense CD/DVD to
be inserted into the host's drive and start installing a soon as the
virtual machine is powered on.

-  **Client Device**

To install from the CD/DVD drive in the vSphere Client PC, select the
Client Device option. As the contents of the CD will be read across the
network, this will be a bit slower than using a drive in the ESXi host.
In addition, Connect at power on is not available.

-  **Datastore ISO**

To install from an ISO image stored in an ESXi datastore, that is also
an option but it won't be covered here. This is much faster than the
other options, and more convenient to keep the install media around for
re-use.

Click **Finish**.

Installing pfSense Software
---------------------------

Booting the VM from CD/DVD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Option 1: Installing from the CD/DVD drive on the ESXi host**

If the Host Device option was chosen in the Virtual Machine
Properties above, slip the pfSense CD into the drive on the ESXi
host.

In the left-hand pane of the vSphere client window, right-click
the new pfSense virtual machine. A number of actions for VM are
displayed, including **Power** > **Power on**. Select that or
highlight the virtual machine and click the green arrowhead in
the toolbar.

Now click the **Console** tab and the virtual machine will begin
booting from the CD.

Skip to **Installing pfSense Software.**

**Option 2: Installing from the CD/DVD drive on the client**

If the option was chosen to use the drive in the client PC, put
the CD into its drive. Remember that **Connect at power on** was
not a choice if using the client's CD/DVD drive, so a little bit
of extra work is needed to connect it after powering on the
virtual machine.

In the left-hand pane of the vSphere client window, right-click
the new pfSense virtual machine. A number of actions for VM are
displayed, including **Power** > **Power on**. Select that or
highlight the virtual machine and click the green arrowhead in
the toolbar.

Now, with the virtual machine highlighted, click the **Console**
tab.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4-1a.png
   :align: center

Because the CD drive is not attached to the virtual machine yet,
it may attempt to boot from the network or it may be showing an
*Operating system not found* or some other error. Don't worry
about this.

At this point (and only after the virtual machine has been
powered on) the virtual machine may be attached to the CD/DVD
drive on the client PC. Click on the toolbar icon that looks
like a CD with a wrench/spanner. **CD/DVD Drive 1** will be
offered in the menu and the available choices are displayed.
Select Connect to D: (or whatever drive letter represents the
CD/DVD drive on the client PC).

Right click the virtual machine in the left pane of the vSphere
client and select **Guest > Send Ctl+Alt+Del**. This will reboot
the virtual machine without disconnecting the CD/DVD drive.

In the Console tab, the pfSense installer can now be seen booting
from the CD.

Installing pfSense Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If everything has gone well the pfSense boot menu be shown.

**What follows is very much a standard pfSense installation procedure.
However, it's included here to save jumping around between documents.**

.. note:: To enter information through the virtual machine's console, it
   is necessary to click inside the console window. To release the cursor,
   press Ctl+Alt.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4-1a.png
   :align: center

Allow the timer to expire and boot the pfSense software from the "Live CD".

When the following console message is seen:

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4-3a.png
   :align: center

Type *i* to launch the pfSense installer.

The next few screens are the standard pfSense install screens and are
fairly self explanatory. Take the highlighted choice in each of the
following screenshots:

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4_4a.png
   :align: center

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4_5a.png
   :align: center

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4_6a.png
   :align: center

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4_7a.png
   :align: center

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4_8a.png
   :align: center

At this point the pfSense virtual machine will reboot and **the CD must
be removed from the drive**.

Interface Assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next up, the pfSense boot menu returns.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4-2a.png
   :align: center

As the pfSense software is already installed on the virtual disk,
allow the timer to expire.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4_9a.png
   :align: center

Once the pfSense software has booted the message: **Network interface
mismatch â Running interface assignment option** is shown. This 
means that the pfSense instance has not yet been told which virtual
network interface is LAN and which is WAN.

.. note:: As mentioned previously, on pfSense software version 2.2 and
   later, the choices in the default configuration are *em0* for WAN
   and *em1* for LAN, so WAN should be assigned to NIC 1. This may
   differ from the screenshots shown here. The interface assignment
   prompt will no longer appear for hosts using *em* NICs, so be
   careful not to attach a LAN to *em0*!

First of all, though, as VLANs are not needed, type *n* and press
**return**.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4_10a.png
   :align: center

The order that the virtual NICs were assigned to the pfSense instance 
when the virtual machine was setup is important here. Generally, ESXi
presents those network interfaces to the pfSense instance in sequence.
That is, the pfSense virtual machine sees NIC 1 (WAN) as em0, NIC 2
(LAN) as em1, etc.

.. note:: The MAC addresses assigned to the virtual NICs and seen by the
   pfSense VM are also virtual. They are not the MAC addresses of the
   physical NICs.

To double check which virtual NIC is which, right-click the virtual
machine in the left-hand pane of the vSphere client and choose **Edit
Settings**. Selecting each of the network adapters (WAN, LAN, etc) will
show the virtual MAC address assigned to that interface. Make a note of
these to help get the correct virtual interface assigned in the pfSense
software. Only the last two characters of the vMAC are generally needed
to match them against those shown in the pfSense console. For example:

WAN = ee LAN = f8

So go ahead and enter the WAN interface name, *em0* in this example, and
press return.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4_11a.png
   :align: center

Now enter the LAN interface name, "em1" in this example, and press
return.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4_12a.png
   :align: center

As there are not any OPT interfaces, yet, press return.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4_13a.png
   :align: center

Lastly, check that the interface assignments are correct, enter "y"
and press return.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_4_14a.png
   :align: center

After a short interval, the pfSense VM will reconfigure itself,
restart and present the main pfSense screen, above.

If the modem (in this example a simple cable modem) is connected to the
physical WAN port of the ESXi host, the WAN interface should have
received a public IP address from the ISP via DHCP. ADSL and other
modems may need to be set up to pass the public IP through to the 
pfSense VM. Other types of WAN connections and configurations are
beyond the scope of this article.

The LAN interface has its installation default IP address of
192.168.1.1. If another network address and/or subnet is desired, it may
be changed from the console or GUI.

Adding a DMZ
------------

Having a WAN and a LAN is fine but perhaps another virtual machine will
be added to the virtual network â maybe a mail server or a web server.
After all, that is likely to be one of the reasons ESXi was used in the
first place â as an alternative to running multiple physical machines.

These kinds of servers should be accessible from the Internet but, at
the same time, be protected behind the pfSense firewall. That way access
can be controlled to them from both the LAN and the WAN.

Another interesting aspect of virtualization is that it is not necessary
to stop at one DMZ. Because the DMZ network can be completely virtual,
additional physical NICs are not required. For example, a virtual mail
server could be put in one DMZ and a virtual web server in another.
Then, by connecting them through the pfSense VM with virtual NICs, all
access between the DMZs may be controlled. In addition, if one server is
compromised, access to any of the others will be more difficult.

That's not to say that a DMZ can't also be connected to a real physical
network as well. It may be desirable to connect a game console or
video/music server behind the pfSense VM but not have it directly
connected to the LAN. To accomplish that, connect a physical NIC to the
ESX system and attach it as a DMZ.

Creating the DMZ network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the vSphere client and highlight the ESXi host. Click the
Configuration tab and the Networking link. The ESXi network diagram is
displayed.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_5_1.png
   :align: center

Click the Add Networking link near the top right of the Network pane.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_5_1a.png
   :align: center

We want to add a new virtual machine network, so select that option
and click Next.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_5_2a.png
   :align: center

Choose the option to Create a vSphere standard switch. We aren't going
to need a physical NIC â it is going to be virtual - so make sure that
if there are more physical NICs in the ESXi host, none of them are
selected, then click **Next**

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_5_3a.png
   :align: center

As with the LAN and WAN, give the new network a name. "DMZ" would be
good. Click **Next**.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_5_4a.png
   :align: center

Click Finish.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_5_5a.png
   :align: center

Now the Networking diagram will look like this - just a vSwitch and a
Virtual Machine Port group called "DMZ" with no physical NICs
attached.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_5_5b.png
   :align: center

The next step is to connect the pfSense VM to this new DMZ network.
Right-click the pfSense virtual machine and select **Edit Settings**.
Click the **Add** button.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_5_6.png
   :align: center

Choose **Ethernet adapter** and click Next.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_5_7.png
   :align: center

As was done for WAN and LAN, choose the **E1000** type of virtual
network adapter. Select **DMZ** from the drop-down list of available
networks and choose **Connect at power on**. Click **Next**.

.. image:: /_static/virtualization/esxi_pfs_5_8.png
   :align: center

Now the network diagram should look like the above.

.. note:: all of this may be done while the pfSense virtual machine is
   still running. To make the pfSense VM aware of the changes, though,
   it will need to be restarted and then the interface must be assigned.

Now additional virtual machines may be attached to the DMZ network.

Installing VMware Tools
-----------------------

There are a number of benefits to installing the VMware tools, including
better memory management, as well as improved network and disk
performance. I can't vouch for those benefits but I find the most useful
feature is the ability to shutdown or reboot a virtual machine without
needing to log in to it directly. I use this to have all my VMs and the
ESXi host gracefully shutdown in the event of a power outage that might
exhaust the UPS battery ... but that's another story.

The VMware Tools have been made available as a pfSense package, which
makes the install very quick and easy.

Log in to the pfSense webGUI and click **System > Packages**.

From the **Available Packages** tab list, look for the **Open-VM-Tools**
package and click |fa-plus| on the right to install the package. Confirm the
the package installation and then it will proceed.

There is really nothing to configure with this package, it should just
work.

Alternately, the official VMware tools can be used, but it is a much
more manual process. See here: :doc:`VMware Tools </virtualization/installing-vmware-guest-tools>`
