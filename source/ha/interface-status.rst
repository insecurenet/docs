Interface Status
================

In the pfSenseÂ®webGUI, **Status > Interfaces** shows each interface,
along with various statistics about them.

For each interface, this screen will show the status (Such as up/no
carrier), MAC address, IP address, Subnet mask, Gateway (if relevant),
DNS servers (if relevant), Media type (such as 100Mbit, 1000Mbit, etc),
in/out packets, in/out packets passed and blocked, errors, and
collisions.

Depending on the interface type, such as Wireless, other information may
also be available.

For PPP-based connection types, a **Connect** or **Disconnect** button
is displayed depending on the current connection state.

For DHCP interfaces, a **Release** or **Renew** button is displayed
depending on the current connection state.
