Gateway Logs
============

The gateway logs can be found through the pfSenseÂ® webGUI under 
**Status > System Logs** on the **System**/**Gateways** sub-tab.

This log contains entries from the gateway monitoring daemon, *dpinger*,
which can generate a significant amount of logging with many gateways to
monitor.

The entries found here will record events such as when a gateway is
down, or in an alarm state, or has returned to an online state.
