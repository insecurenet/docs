-  **Port**: The port on the **Host** which is listening for NetFlow
   data

Controlling softflowd from the Command Line
-------------------------------------------

To view statistics about the running softflowd process, run the
following command, replacing *em0* with the actual network interface to
query::

  : softflowctl -c /var/run/softflowd.em0.ctl statistics

To expire all flows and force an update to be sent to the netflow
server, run the following command, replacing *em0* with the actual
network interface to control::
