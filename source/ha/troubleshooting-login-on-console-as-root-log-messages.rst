Troubleshooting "login on console as root" Log Messages
=======================================================

Occasionally, the following messages may appear in the system log::

  login: login on console as root

or::

  login: login on ttyv0 as root

This is normal. It means that the console menu stopped and restarted, or someone
pressed enter (didn't choose a menu option) at the console menu. To suppress
these messages, enable password protection for the console login and then it
will only login after authentication. If console logins are already enabled,
then this means someone logged into the console.

To password protect the console:

* Click **System > Advanced**
* Find the **Console Options** section near the end of the page
* Check **Password protect the console menu**
* Click **Save**
