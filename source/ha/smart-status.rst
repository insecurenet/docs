SMART Status
============

If a hard drive is present in the firewall that supports reporting its
status by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T. S.M.A.R.T.], it can
be viewed by visiting **Diagnostics > SMART Status**.

The most common views to use are:

-  **Health report**, which provides a simple pass/fail of the drive
   status
-  **Attributes**, which lists the individual S.M.A.R.T. data points
-  **All**, shows all available information

Drive tests may also be initiated, and the results of the tests may be
viewed. These tests can be performed while the system is running, but
may impact performance of disk operations during the test.
