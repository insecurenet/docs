Using an Alternate Monitor IP Address for Gateway Monitoring
============================================================

In many scenarios, the quality graph for an interface may not be as accurate as
desired. The most common scenario is when a gateway, (i.e. the next hop), is
local to the site and not on the other end of an Internet or remote connection.

To use an alternate address, do as follows:

* Navigate to **System > Routing**
* Click |fa-pencil| to edit the gateway
* Enter the IP address to ping for gateway monitoring in **Monitor IP**
* Click **Save**
* Click **Apply Changes**
