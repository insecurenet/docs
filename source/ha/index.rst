pfSenseÂ® software provides a wealth of information about the state of the
firewall, its services, traffic flowing through the firewall, and log data.

Logs

Logs in pfSense software contain recent events and messages from daemons.
These messages can be stored locally on a limited basis, or forwarded to a
central logging server for long-term storage, better reporting, alerting,
and so on.
