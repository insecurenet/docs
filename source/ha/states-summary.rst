States Summary
==============

The **States Summary** page found at **Diagnostics > States Summary**
reads the current state table and presents a summarized view with
information collected in several different ways:

-  By Source IP

   -  Useful for seeing if a given source IP has an abnormally high
      number of states, and a summary of where they go by protocol.

-  By Destination IP

   -  Useful for seeing if a given destination IP has an abnormally high
      number of states, and a summary of where they go by protocol.

-  Total Per IP

   -  Useful for seeing if a given IP has an abnormally high number of
      states in both directions, and a summary of where they go by
      protocol.

-  By IP Pair

   -  Useful for seeing if a given source IP and destination IP has an
      abnormally high number of states between them, and a summary by
      protocol.

This page may not render properly with large state tables. It requires a
lot of processing, so larger state tables may take too long to display,
or may run out of memory building the report.
