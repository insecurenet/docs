Documentation Quality Guidelines
================================

Overview
--------

This document aims to give an idea of what types of information should
be in articles to keep them as useful as possible for other users of the
documentation.

For information about style and formatting, see
:doc:`../references/style-guide`.

What to include in articles
---------------------------

-  Concise, detailed information - the more accurate the information, the more
   useful it is.
-  Good spelling and
   `grammar <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gv0H-vPoDc>`__
-  Good formatting (:doc:`../references/style-guide`)
-  Proper categories to classify the article. For example, place the new article
   in the correct area of the documentation site (e.g. articles about OpenVPN
   go under ``source/vpn/openvpn/``).

What not to include in articles
-------------------------------

-  Poor grammar
-  Inconsistent or poor backing data
-  Disparaging comments
-  Ambiguity - try to make articles clear so there is no confusion
-  Avoid creating a new directory or category for a single article if possible.
   If more will be added, then it is OK.
-  Redundant information already covered in other articles. Especially
   in How-To articles.
-  Do not start a how-to with installing pfSense or performing other basic
   tasks. Make assumptions and link to other articles for topics already covered
   elsewhere. There is no need to reinvent the wheel and have multiple confusing
   copies of the same information. Keep How-To articles as concise as possible!

Where to see why an article was flagged
---------------------------------------

Articles flagged for cleanup should have corresponding comments on the `source
of the article at Github
<https://github.com/pfsense/docs/tree/master/source>`__, or `issues on Github
<https://github.com/pfsense/docs/issues/>`__ discussing what's wrong with them.
