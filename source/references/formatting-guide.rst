Formatting Guide
================

The pfSenseÂ® documentation is built using Sphinx/reStructuredText. The formatting
is similar in some ways to Markdown, but has significant differences. To get a
feel for the formatting, look at the `source of this documentation`_ and read
through this document.

.. tip:: Test out how different markup is rendered using the `Online
   reStructuredText editor`_. Additional information can be found at `A primer
   on reStructuredText`_ and `reST/Sphinx cheat sheet`_.

Filenames
---------

When adding new pages or images use all lowercase letters and hyphens instead of
spaces for the filename. This is commonly referred to as a slug, or a slugified
version of the text. For example, this file is named ``formatting-guide.rst``.

.. tip:: You can use an `online slug generator`_ if you don't want to make a
   slug manually.

Text
----

In general, try to keep text in logical paragraphs wrapped at 80 characters.
This ensures the source is easy for everyone to read no matter where it is
being edited. For long pages with several sections that may only be relevant to
some users, split the page into several smaller documents.

Basic Inline Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add basic inline formatting to the text as follows:

* one asterisk: ``*text*`` for *emphasis* (italics),
* two asterisks: ``**text**`` for **strong emphasis** (boldface), and
* backquotes: ````text```` for ``code samples``.
* Two colons at the end of a line (or on a blank line) to start a code block,
  prefix each line inside the block with two spaces::

    code

These can be applied to text in various ways within the documentation:

* Menu references use bold text and ">" with spaces in between to separate menus
  from menu items: **System > General**

  * Navigation that also refers to a tab name should be formatted like so:
    **System > Advanced**, **Miscellaneous** tab.

* GUI text references and option names use bold text: **Description**
* Text to be entered or replaced by the user uses backquotes: Enter
  ``192.168.1.1`` for the **IPv4 Address**.
* Options selected by the user from a list or drop-down are italic: Select *WAN*
  for the the **Interface**.
* File names and paths use backquotes: ``/root``
* Commands names inline with other text use backquotes, "The ``sudo`` command
  ...".
* Shell commands being demonstrated or directed use code blocks. Lead the line
  with two spaces then "#" to simulate a command prompt:

  .. code:: console

     # ls -l /root

* Program output also uses code blocks, blank lines in output can either be
  blank or preceded by two spaces:

  .. code:: console

     # someprogram
     Output:

     Foo

Headings
--------

Headings consist of text and a line of characters underneath ("underline") the
same length as the text. The specific characters must be consistent to denote
sections of the same depth. Parts and chapters also use a similar row of
characters above the text ("overline").

* ``####`` with overline, for parts
* ``****`` with overline, for chapters
* ``====``, for sections
* ``----``, for subsections
* ``^^^^``, for subsubsections
* ``""""``, for paragraphs

.. note:: The headings are also how the "On This Page" section is generated.
   When possible, it is a good idea to use headings that create an outline of
   the content, making it easy for the reader to scan.

Lists
-----

Unordered Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Place an asterisk at the start of a paragraph and indent two spaces for any
lines that wrap.

.. code:: console

   * This is a bulleted list.
   * It has two items, the second
     item uses two lines.

Which renders as:

* This is a bulleted list.
* It has two items, the second
  item uses two lines.

Ordered lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The same goes for numbered lists; they can will be auto-numbered using ``#.``:

.. code:: console

   #. This is a numbered list.
   #. It has two items too.

Which renders as:

#. This is a numbered list.
#. It has two items too.

Nested lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nested lists are possible, but be aware that they must be separated from the
parent list items by blank lines:

.. code:: console

   * this is
   * a list

     * with a nested list
     * and some subitems

   * and here the parent list continues

Which renders as:

* this is
* a list

  * with a nested list
  * and some subitems

* and here the parent list continues

Definition lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Definition lists are created as follows:

.. code:: console

   term (up to a line of text)
      Definition of the term, which must be indented

      and can even consist of multiple paragraphs

   next term
      Description.

.. note:: The term itself cannot have more than one line of text.

Which renders as:

term (up to a line of text)
   Definition of the term, which must be indented

   and can even consist of multiple paragraphs

next term
   Description.

Field Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^

Field lists are perfect for lists of options:

.. code:: console

   :Option Name: What it does.
   :Option 2: Another option. This is a long description that wraps
     to the next line, with two spaces indentation.
   :Third Option: Something else.

Which renders as:

:Option Name: What it does.
:Option 2: Another option. This is a long description that wraps
  to the next line, with two spaces indentation.
:Third Option: Something else.

Links
-----

External Link
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Separate the link and the target definition, like this:

.. code:: console

  This is a paragraph that contains `a link`_.

.. code:: console

  .. _a link: http://example.com/

and place the target definition at the bottom of the page in alphabetical order.

.. note:: If the link text will contain a colon, escape it in both the link text
   and the definition, for example::

     See `Link\: Stuff`_.

   .. code:: console

       .. _Link\: Stuff: http://example.com/stuff

Cross Reference to Section of Document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make a cross reference to another document, first you must create a label
immediately before the section title:

.. code:: console

   .. _label-some-section:

   Some Section
   ------------

And then in the other document, reference it using ``:ref:`` and the given label:

.. code:: console

   See :ref:`label-some-section` for more information

Cross Reference to Entire Document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a cross-reference will instead reference an entire document rather than a
specific section, use the ``:doc:`` method instead.

For example, to reference this entire document, ``/references/style-guide.rst``,
use the following text, omitting the file extension:

.. code:: console

   :doc:`/references/style-guide`

Images
------

Images
^^^^^^

Place images in the ``source/_static`` directory in the same folder structure as
the page that the image is going to be posted on. For example, an image going
on ``source/references/fomatting-guide.rst`` would go in
``source/_static/references/image.png``.

.. code:: console

   .. image:: /_static/filename.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Alternative text that describes the image
      :target: /_static/filename.png

.. note:: ``:target:`` is optional and only necessary if it is a large image.

Figures
^^^^^^^

Place figures in the ``source/_static`` directory in the same folder structure as
the page that the image is going to be posted on. For example, an image going
on ``source/references/fomatting-guide.rst`` would go in
``source/_static/references/image.png``.

Figures are similar to images, but need a unique label and a caption for proper
in-text references.

.. code:: console

   .. _figure-my-stuff:
   .. figure:: /_static/stuff.png
      :figclass: align-center
      :target: /_static/stuff.png

      This is the caption

Which can be referred to using the following:

.. code:: console

   An example is shown in Figure :ref:`figure-my-stuff`.

.. note::  The indention is important! The caption *must* be aligned properly
   with the other attributes!

Inline Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For an inline image (no breaks above or below, aka inline with the text) a
substitution must be used. Since inline images are typically inserted on many
pages, the inline image file can be placed in the root of ``source/_static``.

Many common icon substitutions are available in a `common substitutions file`_
usable as follows:

.. code:: console

   .. include:: substitutions.rst
   <lots of other text>
   To add a blah, click |image_icon_plus|.

To do this in a one-off fashion, use a substitution within the same file:

.. code:: console

   Click |image_icon_edit| to edit the entry
   <rest of page>
   .. |image_icon_edit| image:: _static/icon_e.png

Tables
------

Grid Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^

The grid must be "painted", they look like this example:

.. code:: console

   +------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
   | Header row, column 1   | Header 2   | Header 3 | Header 4 |
   | (header rows optional) |            |          |          |
   +========================+============+==========+==========+
   | body row 1, column 1   | column 2   | column 3 | column 4 |
   +------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
   | body row 2             | ...        | ...      |          |
   +------------------------+------------+----------+----------+

Simple Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are easier to write, but are limited: they must contain more than
one row, and the first column cells cannot contain multiple lines.  They look
like this:

.. code:: console

   =====  =====  =======
   A      B      A and B
   =====  =====  =======
   False  False  False
   True   False  False
   False  True   False
   True   True   True
   =====  =====  =======

Table of Contents
-----------------

Every file has to a part of a ``toctree`` or **Table of Contents** tree, as this
is how the side navigation is built.

Reference RST files by their filenames without their ``.rst`` extension. It is
also possible to link to external resources if necessary, as shown with the
YouTube link:

.. code:: console

  .. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 2

     filename1
     filename2
     sub-directory/index
     Example YouTube Video <https://youtu.be/Cwz7vWu_KO0>

Local Table of Contents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes it is useful to add the table of contents of the current page:

.. code:: console

   .. contents:: :depth: 2

Colored Boxes
-------------

Admonitions are text, distinguished in friendly boxes, that bring attention to
important items. The most common example is a "Note" box:

.. code:: console

   .. note:: This is a note, it will be surrounded by a note box when it is built.

Which renders as:

.. note:: This is a note, it will be surrounded by a note box when it is built.

Admonitions are available for a wide variety of types, including:

* ``note``
* ``tip``
* ``warning``
* ``attention``
* ``caution``
* ``danger``
* ``error``
* ``hint``
* ``important``
* ``seealso``

Substitutions
-------------

reST supports "substitutions", which are pieces of text and/or markup referred
to in the text by ``|name|``.  They are defined like footnotes with explicit
markup blocks, like this:

.. code:: console

   .. |name| replace:: replacement *text*

or this:

.. code:: console

   .. |caution| image:: warning.png
                :alt: Warning!

To use substitutions for multiple documents, put them into a separate file and
include it into all documents where they will be used, using the ``include``
directive. Give the include file a file name extension differing from that of
other source files, such as ``.rsti``, to avoid Sphinx finding it as a
standalone document.

A `common substitutions file`_ is available and is already referenced in a
number of existing documents. Check that file before adding more substitutions
in other files. Substitutions which will be widely used in many documents should
be placed there.

Literal (code) Blocks
---------------------

Briefly described earlier, literal or "code" blocks allow for pre-formatted
text, most commonly used for source code, shell commands, command output, and so
on.

A code block can be started by ending a sentence with two colons, and then a
blank line. These two colons may also be on a line by themselves::

  ::

    code code code

The lines inside the code block must be indented to the same level, usually two
spaces.

Blank spaces may be used between lines of code, they do not need to contain
spaces.

For more complex examples, syntax highlighting can be used for source code using
the ``code-block`` directive:

.. code:: console

   .. code-block:: html
      :linenos:

      <b>some html</b>

Which renders as:

.. code-block:: html
   :linenos:

   <b>some html</b>
