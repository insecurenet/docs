Using Cisco VPN Pass Through Behind pfSense
===========================================

If trouble is encountered when attempting a connection from an internal
Cisco VPN client to an external host, (e.g. a workstation with the Cisco
client is trying to get out through a pfSenseÂ® firewall to connect to a
"foreign" site), then try the following.

Workaround
----------

-  In the Cisco VPN client software, Modify the connection and turn off
   transparent tunneling completely in the **Transport** tab.
-  In the pfSense webGUI, under **Firewall > NAT** on the **Outbound**
   tab:

    -  Enable **Manual Outbound NAT**.
    -  Remove any NAT rules that perform static port NAT on udp/500.
