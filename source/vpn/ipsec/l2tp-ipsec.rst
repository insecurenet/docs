L2TP/IPsec
==========

L2TP/IPsec is a common VPN type that wraps L2TP, an insecure tunneling
protocol, inside a secure channel built using transport mode IPsec.

L2TP/IPsec is supported starting with pfSenseÂ® software version 2.2-RELEASE.
This article will explain how to configure the service and setup clients.

.. warning:: Users have reported issues with Windows L2TP/IPsec clients behind
   NAT. If the clients will be behind NAT, Windows clients will most likely not
   function. Consider an IKEv2 implementation instead.

Setup L2TP
----------

Configure L2TP Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*  Navigate to **VPN > L2TP**
*  Select *Enable L2TP server*
*  Set **Interface** to *WAN*
*  Set **Server Address** to an unused private subnet
   IP, such as *192.168.32.1*

   .. note:: This is **not** a public IP address or "listen" IP for the
      L2TP service, it is a local IP address set as the "gateway" on the
      clients

*  Set **Remote Address Range** to an unused private subnet, such as
   *192.168.32.128*
*  Set **Subnet Mask** to an appropriate value for the client address
   range, such as *25*
*  Set **Number of L2TP Users** to the highest concurrent number of
   expected L2TP users, such as *8*
*  Leave **Secret** blank
*  Set **Authentication Type** to *CHAP*
*  Set **L2TP DNS Servers** as needed, or leave blank
*  Set **RADIUS** options if desired

Add L2TP Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If RADIUS is not being used, add L2TP users to the pfSense configuration.

*  Navigate to **VPN > L2TP**, **Users** tab
*  Click |fa-plus| To add a new user
*  Fill in **Username**, **Password/Confirmation**
*  Set a static **IP address** if needed, in the chosen subnet
*  Click Save

Repeat as needed for additional users.

Setup IPsec
-----------

With the L2TP server prepared, the next task is to configure the
necessary IPsec settings. The settings below have been tested and found
to work, but other similar settings may function as well. Feel free to
try other encryption algorithms, hashes, etc. Report any additional
combinations found to work or not work on the forum.

Mobile Clients Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*  Navigate to **VPN > IPsec**, **Mobile Clients** tab in the pfSense
   webGUI
*  Check **Enable IPsec Mobile Client Support**
*  Set **User Authentication** to *Local Database* (Not used, but the
   option must have something selected)
*  Uncheck **Provide a virtual IP address to clients**
*  Uncheck **Provide a list of accessible networks to clients**
*  Click **Save**

Phase 1
^^^^^^^

*  Click the **Tunnels** Tab
*  Check **Enable IPsec**
*  Click **Save**
*  Click the **Create Phase1** button at the top if it appears, or edit
   the existing Mobile IPsec Phase 1

   *  If there is no Phase 1, and the **Create Phase1** button does not
      appear, navigate back to the **Mobile Clients** tab and click it
      there.

*  Set **Key Exchange version** to *v1*
*  Enter an appropriate **Description**
*  Set **Authentication method** to *Mutual PSK*
*  Set **Negotiation Mode** to *Main*
*  Set **My Identifier** to *My IP address*
*  Set **Encryption algorithm** to *AES 256*
*  Set **Hash algorithm** to *SHA1*
*  Set **DH key group** to *14 (2048 bit)*

   .. note:: iOS and other platforms may work with a **DH key group** of
      *2* instead.

*  Set **Lifetime** to *28800*
*  Uncheck **Disable Rekey**
*  Uncheck **Disable Reauth**
*  Set **NAT Traversal** to *Auto*
*  Check **Enable DPD**, set for *10* seconds and *5* retries
*  Click **Save**

Phase 2
^^^^^^^

*  Click |fa-plus| to show the Mobile IPsec Phase 2 list
*  Click |fa-plus| to add a new Phase 2 entry if one does not exist, or click
   |fa-pencil| to edit an existing entry
*  Set **Mode** to **Transport**
*  Enter an appropriate **Description**
*  Set **Protocol** to *ESP*
*  Set **Encryption algorithms** to ONLY *AES 128*
*  Set **Hash algorithms** to ONLY *SHA1*
*  Set **PFS Key Group** to *off*
*  Set **Lifetime** to *3600*
*  Click **Save**

Pre-Shared Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the IPsec tunnel itself ready, now the pre-shared key must be
configured in a special way, which is common for all clients.

*  Navigate to **VPN > IPsec**, **Pre-Shared Keys** tab in the pfSense
   webGUI
*  Click |fa-plus| to add a new PSK
*  Set the **Identifier** to *allusers*

   .. note:: The "allusers" name is a special keyword used by pfSense 
      software to configure a wildcard PSK, which is necessary for
      L2TP/IPsec to function. Do not use any other **Identifier** for
      this PSK!

*  Set **Secret Type** to *PSK*
*  Enter a **Pre-Shared Key**, such as *aaabbbccc* -- ideally one a lot
   longer and more random/secure than this example!
*  Click **Save**
*  Click **Apply Changes**

Firewall Rules and NAT
----------------------

Firewall rules are necessary to pass traffic from the client host over
IPsec to establish the L2TP tunnel, and inside L2TP to pass the actual
tunneled VPN traffic to systems across the VPN.

IPsec Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^

*  Navigate to **Firewall > Rules**, **IPsec** tab
*  Review the current rules. If there is an "allow all" style rule, then
   there is no need to add another. Continue to the next task.
*  Click |fa-plus| to add a new rule
*  Set the **Protocol** to *any*, and set the **Source** and
   **Destination** to *any* as well

   .. note:: This does not have to pass all traffic, but must at least
      pass L2TP (UDP port 1701) to the WAN IP address of the firewall

*  Click **Save**
*  Click **Apply Changes**

L2TP Rules
^^^^^^^^^^

*  Navigate to **Firewall > Rules**, **L2TP VPN** tab
*  Review the current rules. If there is an "allow all" style rule, then
   there is no need to add another. Continue to the next task.
*  Click |fa-plus| to add a new rule
*  Set the **Protocol** to *any*, and set the **Source** and
   **Destination** to *any* as well

   .. note:: This does not have to pass all traffic, stricter rules are
      possible to limit where clients can go

*  Click **Save**
*  Click **Apply Changes**

Outbound NAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If clients must pass over the VPN and then back out to the Internet,
outbound NAT will most likely be necessary.

*  Navigate to **Firewall > NAT**, **Outbound** tab
*  Check the rules and see if they will apply to L2TP clients. In
   automatic or hybrid modes, the L2TP subnet should be listed in the
   automatic rules section.
*  Add rule(s) to cover the L2TP clients if Manual Outbound NAT is
   enabled and none are present.

DNS Configuration
-----------------

If DNS servers are supplied to the clients, and if the Unbound DNS
Resolver is used, then the subnet chosen for the L2TP clients must be
added to its access list.

*  Navigate to **Services > DNS Resolver**, **Access Lists** tab
*  Click |fa-plus| to add a new access list
*  Enter an **Access List Name**, such as *VPN Users*
*  Set **Action** to *Allow*
*  Click |fa-plus| under **Networks** to add a new network
*  Enter the VPN client subnet into the **Network** box, e.g.
   *192.168.32.128*
*  Choose the proper **CIDR**, e.g. *25*
*  Click **Save**
*  Click **Apply Changes**

Client Setup
------------

Windows
^^^^^^^

Now it is time to create the client VPN connection. There are several
ways to add such a connection, depending on the version of Windows being
used. Adapt as needed.

*  Open **Network and Sharing Center** on the client PC
*  Click **Set up a new connection or network**
*  Select *Connect to a workplace*
*  Click **Next**
*  Select *No, create a new connection*
*  Click **Next**
*  Click **Use my Internet Connection (VPN)**
*  Enter the IP address or hostname of the server into the Internet
   address field
*  Enter a **Destination Name** to identify the connection
*  Click **Create**

The connection has been added but with several undesirable defaults. For
example the type defaults to automatic and it will latch onto a PPTP
connection if one exists, which is very bad. So a few settings should be
set by hand first:

*  In Network Connection / Adapter Settings in Windows, find the
   connection created above
*  Right click the connection
*  Click **Properties**
*  Click the **Security** tab
*  Set **Type of VPN** to *Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol with IPsec
   (L2TP/IPsec)*
*  Click **Advanced settings**
*  Select *Use preshared key for authentication*
*  Enter the **Key** used above, e.g. *aaabbbccc*
*  Click **OK**
*  Set **Data Encryption** to *Require Encryption (disconnect if server
   declines)*
*  Set **Authentication / Allow these protocols** to *Challenge
   Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)* -- set to match the value
   chosen in L2TP
*  Click **OK**

Troubleshooting
---------------

Firewall traffic blocked outbound
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the firewall logs show traffic blocked "out" on L2TP, then add a
floating firewall rule to work around the block:

*  Navigate to **Firewall > Rules**, **Floating** tab
*  Click |fa-plus| to add a new rule
*  Set **Action** to *Pass*
*  Check **Quick**
*  Select *L2TP VPN* for the **Interface**
*  Set **Direction** to *Out*
*  Set **Protocol** to *TCP*
*  Set **Source**/**Destination** as needed, or set to *any*
*  Advanced Features:

   *  Set **TCP Flags** to *Any flags*
   *  Set **State Type** to *Sloppy State*
