IPsec Logs
==========

The IPsec logs show output from the IPsec daemon. Normal output,
successful connections, as well as errors are all displayed here. On
pfSenseÂ® software version 2.1.x and before, this output is from the 
**racoon** daemon. On pfSense software version 2.2 and later this
task is handled by **strongswan**

Where possible, if a log message contains an IP address of a configured
IPsec tunnel, that tunnel's description is prepended to the log entry.

Entries found in these logs are covered in depth in the |book_link|, and some
errors are covered in :doc:`IPsec Troubleshooting
</vpn/ipsec/ipsec-troubleshooting>`.
