Troubleshooting IPsec VPNs
==========================

Renegotiation Errors
--------------------

If a tunnel comes up initially, but then fails after a Phase 1 or Phase
2 expiration, try changing the following settings on both ends of the
tunnel:

-  **System > Advanced**, **Miscellaneous** tab: uncheck **Prefer
   Old IPsec SA** (No longer exists on pfSense 2.2.3+)
-  On the IPsec Phase 1 settings, disable **NAT Traversal** (NAT-T)
-  On the IPsec Phase 1 settings, enable **DPD**
-  On the IPsec Phase 2 settings, enter an **Automatically Ping Host**
   in the remote Phase 2 subnet.

Common Errors (strongSwan, pfSense software versions >= 2.2.x)
--------------------------------------------------------------

The following examples have logs edited for brevity but significant
messages remain.

Logging for IPsec is configured at **VPN > IPsec**, **Advanced
Settings** tab. The most useful logging settings for diagnosing tunnel
issues with strongSwan on pfSenseÂ® software version 2.2.x are:

-  **IKE SA**, **IKE Child SA**, and **Configuration Backend** on *Diag*
-  All others on *Control*

Other notable behaviors:

-  If there is an *Aggressive*/*Main* mode mismatch and the side set for
   *Main* initiates, the tunnel will still establish
-  **Lifetime** mismatches do not cause a failure in Phase 1 or Phase 2

Mismatched Identifier with NAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this case, strongSwan is set for a **Peer Identifier** of *Peer IP
address*, but the remote router is actually behind NAT. In this case
strongSwan expects the actual private before-NAT IP address as the
identifier. The racoon daemon was much more relaxed and would match
either address, but strongSwan is more formal/correct.

Responder::

  charon: 10[IKE] remote host is behind NAT
  charon: 10[IKE] IDir '192.0.2.10' does not match to '203.0.113.245'
  [...]
  charon: 10[CFG] looking for pre-shared key peer configs matching 198.51.100.50...203.0.113.245[192.0.2.10]

To correct this condition, change the **Peer Identifier** setting to *IP
Address* and then enter the pre-NAT IP address, which in this example is
*192.0.2.10*.

Incorrect Destination Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When multiple WAN IP addresses are available, such as with CARP VIPs or
IP Alias VIPs, an additional failure mode can occur where the connection
appears in the logs but matches bypasslan or "%any...%any". In this
case, IPsec is configured to listen to one IP address but the client is
connecting to another address. For example, an IPsec Phase 1 entry may
be configured to use the WAN IP address but clients are connecting to a
CARP VIP. In this case, the destination address in the logs will be the
VIP address and not the interface address. Confirm by checking the logs
against "ipsec statusall".

Disappearing Traffic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If IPsec traffic arrives but never appears on the IPsec interface
(enc0), check for conflicting routes/interface IP addresses. For
example, if an IPsec tunnel is configured with a remote network of
192.0.2.0/24 and there is a local OpenVPN server with a tunnel network
of 192.0.2.0/24 then the ESP traffic may arrive, strongSwan may process
the packets, but they never show up on enc0 as arriving to the OS for
delivery.

Resolve the duplicate interface/route and the traffic will begin to
flow.

IPsec Status Page Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the IPsec status page prints errors such as::

  Warning: Illegal string offset 'type' in /etc/inc/xmlreader.inc on line 116

That is a sign that the incomplete xmlreader XML parser is active, which
is triggered by the presence of the file */cf/conf/use_xmlreader*. This
alternate parser can be faster for reading large config.xml files, but
lacks certain features necessary for other areas to function well.
Removing */cf/conf/use_xmlreader* will return the system to the default
parser immediately, which will correct the display of the IPsec status
page.

Common Errors (racoon, pfSense software versions <= 2.1.x)
----------------------------------------------------------

Mismatched Local/Remote Subnets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

  Feb 20 10:33:41  racoon: ERROR: failed to pre-process packet.
  Feb 20 10:33:41  racoon: ERROR: failed to get sainfo.

This can result from mismatched subnet masks in the IPsec tunnel
definitions. Check to be sure that the local and remote subnet masks
match up on each side, typically they should be "*/24*" and not "*/32*".

Failed pfkey align
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

  racoon: ERROR: libipsec failed pfkey align (Invalid sadb message)

Check to make sure that the Phase 2 timeouts match up on both ends of
the tunnel. Some people still see this periodically with no ill effect.
It shows up at intervals equal to the Phase 2 timeout, but nowhere near
the actual expiration time.

pfkey Delete
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

  ERROR: pfkey DELETE received

This message may be seen repeatedly as Phase 2 is renegotiated between
two endpoints (for multiple subnets). The tunnels still work, but
traffic may be delayed while the tunnel is switched/reestablished. (more
research needed for possible solutions)

REGISTER message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

  racoon: INFO: unsupported PF_KEY message REGISTER

This is a normal log message. It is not indicative of any problem.

Stuck/Broken Phase 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client::

  racoon: ERROR: none message must be encrypted

Server::

  racoon: ERROR: can't start the quick mode, there is no ISAKMP-SA

Or also::

  racoon: INFO: request for establishing IPsec-SA was queued due to no phase1 found.

Try to stop and restart racoon on the client/opposite side. This can
turn up if one side still thinks Phase 1 is good/active, and the other
side thinks it is gone.

Unsupported Cipher Key Length for Cryptographic Accelerator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a cryptographic accelerator chip such as glxsb is enabled and an
unsupported cipher key length is configured, the following errors may be
displayed::

  Mar 27 16:31:44   racoon: ERROR: pfkey ADD failed: Invalid argument
  Mar 27 16:31:44   racoon: ERROR: pfkey UPDATE failed: Invalid argument
  Mar 27 16:31:44   racoon: WARNING: attribute has been modified.

The reason for this is that the crypto(9) framework in FreeBSD specifies
support by family, such as AES, not not just by key length. The glxsb
chip only accelerates AES 128, so if another key length is chosen such
as AES 256, the operation will fail.

To remedy this, either use a supported key length for the configured
chip (e.g. AES 128) or disable the accelerator and reboot the device to
ensure its modules are unloaded. Physically removing the device may be
required for certain add-in boards.

This is a problem in crypto(9) in FreeBSD upstream and it is not likely
to be fixed.

Send Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

  Sep 18 11:48:10 racoon: ERROR: sendto (Operation not permitted)
  Sep 18 11:48:10 racoon: ERROR: sendfromto failed
  Sep 18 11:48:10 racoon: ERROR: phase1 negotiation failed due to send error.

Errors such as those above are due to something preventing racoon from
sending packets out. Typically this is related to states, but could also
be from an improperly crafted floating rule.

First, check **Diagnostics > States**. Filter on the remote peer
address. If there is a NAT state for an internal client, the default
static port outbound NAT rule could be preventing racoon from building
its own tunnel as the IP:port pairing on both sides is already in use.
Locate and stop the internal client, clear the states, and then
reconnect. If a state is present but there is no NAT involved, clear the
state(s) that are seen for the remote IP and port 500, 4500, and ESP.
Check if that brings it back online.

Also ensure a proper route or default route to reach the remote side is
present.

If that doesn't apply, check the floating rules and be sure they are not
blocking traffic from racoon.

If those are both OK, ensure the PPTP server address is not set to a
valid/in-use IP address such as the WAN address. If that is set to the
WAN address, when a PPTP client disconnects it can cause problems with
racoon's ability to make connections.

INVALID-PAYLOAD-TYPE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a message containing INVALID-PAYLOAD-TYPE appears in the logs, try
disabling NAT Traversal (NAT-T) in Phase 1, and optionally restart
racoon.

NAT Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the tunnel can initiate one way but not the other, and the settings
match, the problem could also be with outbound NAT. If outbound NAT
rules are present with a source of "*any*" (``*``), that will also match
outbound traffic from the firewall itself. At best this will rewrite the
source port and at worst it could change the outbound IP entirely
depending on the NAT rule settings.

Check **Diagnostics > States**, filtered on the remote peer IP, or
":500". If a NAT state is present that includes the WAN address of the
firewall as the source, then fix the NAT rules and clear the offending
states.

IPsec Debugging
---------------

On pfSense software version 2.2, the logging options for the IPsec
daemon are located under **VPN > IPsec** on the **Advanced Settings** 
tab and may be adjusted live without affecting the operation of IPsec
tunnels. As mentioned above, the recommended setting for most common
debugging is to set **IKE SA**, **IKE Child SA**, and 
**Configuration Backend** on *Diag* and set all others on *Control*.

Debug mode for racoon on pfSense software version 2.1.x and before may
be enabled by checking the option for it under **System > Advanced** on
the **Miscellaneous** tab on pfSense software version 2.1.x and earlier.
This change is disruptive in that racoon is restarted and all tunnels
are reset.

Shrew Soft VPN Client Debugging
-------------------------------

Open the Trace app. Stop the IKE Service, and go to File, Options.
Change the log output level to debug and click OK. Start the IKE Service
and attempt to connect.

Packet Loss with Certain Protocols
----------------------------------

If packet loss is experienced only when using specific protocols (SMB,
RDP, etc), MSS clamping may be required to reduce the effective MTU of
the VPN. IPsec does not handle fragmented packets very well, and a
reduced MTU will ensure that the packets traversing the tunnel are all
of a size which can be transmitted whole. A good starting point would be
1300, and if that works, slowly increase the MSS until the breaking
point is located, then back off a little from there.

MSS clamping is configured under **System > Advanced** on the
**Miscellaneous** tab on pfSense software version 2.1.x and before. On 
pfSense software version 2.2, it is under **VPN > IPsec** on the 
**Advanced Settings** tab. Check the box to enable MSS Clamping for VPNs,
and fill in the appropriate value.

Some Hosts Work, Others Do Not
------------------------------

If some hosts can communicate across a VPN tunnel and others cannot, it
typically means that for some reason the packets from that client system
are not being routed to the pfSense system. This could happen for a
number of reasons, but the two most common are:

-  Incorrect gateway on client system: the pfSense router needs to be
   the gateway, or the gateway must have a static route for tunnel traffic
   which forwards those packets to the pfSense router.
-  Incorrect subnet mask on the client system: If the VPN subnets are
   close, say 192.168.0.x and 192.168.1.x, ensure that the subnet mask
   is 255.255.255.0 on the client systems. If one of them has an
   incorrect mask, such as 255.255.0.0, it will try to reach the remote
   systems locally and not send the packets out via the gateway.

Dropping Tunnels on ALIX/embedded
---------------------------------

If tunnels are dropped during periods of high IPsec throughput on an
ALIX or other embedded hardware, it may be necessary to disable DPD on
the tunnel. When the CPU on an ALIX is tied up with sending IPsec
traffic, it may not take the time to respond to a DPD request on the
tunnel. As a consequence, the tunnel will fail a DPD check and be
disconnected.

Crash/Panic in NIC driver with IPsec in Backtrace
-------------------------------------------------

If a crash occurs and the backtrace shows signs of both the NIC driver
and IPsec in the backtrace, such as the following edited example::

  Sleeping thread (tid 100066, pid 12) owns a non-sleepable lock
