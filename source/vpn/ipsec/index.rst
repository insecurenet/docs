IPsec
*****

`IPsec`_ is a standards-based VPN protocol which allows traffic to be encrypted
and authenticated between multiple hosts. Being based on published standards
means it is compatible with nearly every other device which also supports IPsec.
This includes a wide variety of third-party software and hardware.

IPsec can be used to carry traffic across untrusted networks. Either between
local networks or to allow remote access clients to reach local resources.
