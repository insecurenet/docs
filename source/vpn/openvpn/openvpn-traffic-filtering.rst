Filtering OpenVPN Traffic
=========================

There is a separate OpenVPN tab used for defining rules to cover the
traffic entering the firewall across the VPN. This tab appears when any
OpenVPN instance is defined.

An OpenVPN instance may be assigned to create per-VPN rules, but the
rules on the OpenVPN tab still apply and are considered before the
per-interface tabs.
