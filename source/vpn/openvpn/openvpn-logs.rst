OpenVPN Logs
============

The OpenVPN logs found through the pfSenseÂ® webGUI at 
**Status > System Logs** and the **OpenVPN** tab show output
from the OpenVPN daemon(s) in use, both clients and servers. Messages
are shown in the logs for successful connections as well as failures and
errors.

If there are no log entries for a server after the process starts,
traffic likely is not reaching the OpenVPN daemon. Check the WAN-side
firewall rules and the address/port used by the client.

There are several OpenVPN troubleshooting articles found in
:doc:`/vpn/openvpn/index`, and in the |book_link|.
