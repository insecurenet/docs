`OpenVPN`_ is an Open Source VPN server and client that is supported on a
variety of platforms, including pfSenseÂ® software. It can be used for 
Site-to-Site or Remote Access VPN configurations.

OpenVPN can work with shared keys or with a PKI setup for SSL/TLS. Remote Access
VPNs may be authenticated locally, or using an external authentication source
such as RADIUS or LDAP.

There are many possible ways to configure OpenVPN in pfSense software, for more
