Snort Pass Lists
================

**Pass Lists** are lists of IP addresses that Snort should never block.
Pass lists can be created and managed on the **Pass Lists** tab. When an
IP address is listed on a Pass List, Snort will never insert a block on
that address even when malicious traffic is detected.

To create a new Pass List, click the |fa-plus| icon. To edit an
existing Pass List, click the |fa-pencil| icon. To delete a Pass List,
click the |fa-trash| icon. Note that a Pass List cannot be deleted if
it is currently assigned to one or more Snort interfaces.

A default Pass List is automatically generated by Snort for every
interface, and this default list is used when no other list is
specified. Assign Pass Lists to an interface on the **Interface
Settings** tab.

Customized Pass Lists can be created and then assigned to an interface.
This might be needed when trusted external hosts are needed that are not
located on networks directly connected to the firewall. To add external
hosts in this manner, first create an Alias under **Firewall > Aliases**
and then assign that alias to the **Assigned Aliases:** field. In the
example shown below, the alias "*Friendly_ext_hosts*" has been
assigned. This alias would contain the IP addresses of the trusted
external hosts.

When creating a custom Pass List, leave all the auto-generated IP
addresses checked in the **Add auto-generated IP addresses** section.
Not selecting the checkboxes in this section can lead to blocking of
critical addresses including the firewall interfaces themselves. This
could result in being locked out of the firewall over the network! Only
uncheck boxes in this section when a valid need is present.

Click the **ALIASES** button to open a window showing previously defined
aliases for selection. Remember to click **SAVE** to save changes.

.. note:: Remember that simply creating a Pass List is only the first
   step! Go to the **Interface Settings** tab for the Snort interface and
   assign the newly created Pass List as shown below. After assigning and
   saving the new Pass List, restart Snort on the affected interface to
   pick up the change.
