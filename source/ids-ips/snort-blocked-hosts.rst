Snort Blocked Hosts
===================

The **Blocked** tab shows what hosts are currently being blocked by
Snort (when the **block offenders** option is selected on the
**Interface Settings** tab). Blocked hosts can be automatically cleared
by Snort at one of several pre-defined intervals. The blocking options
for an interface are configured on the Snort **Interface Settings** tab
for the interface. To manually remove a blocked host, click the
|fa-trash| icon in the right-hand column.

The |fa-search| icon performs a reverse DNS lookup on the blocked host IP
address when clicked.
