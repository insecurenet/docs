Snort Alerts
============

The **Alerts** tab is where alerts generated by Snort may be viewed. If
Snort is running on more than one interface, choose the interface to
view alerts for in the drop-down selector.

Use the **DOWNLOAD** button to download a gzip tar file containing all
of the logged alerts to a local machine. The **CLEAR** button is used to
erase the current alerts log.

**Alert Details**

The **Date** column shows the date and time the alert was generated. The
remaining columns show data from the rule that generated the alert.

In the **Source**, **Destination** columns are |fa-search| icons for performing
reverse DNS lookups on the IP addresses as well as a |fa-plus-square-o| icon
used to add an automatic :doc:`Suppress List </ids-ips/setup-snort-package>`
entry for the alert using the IP address and SID (signature ID). This will
prevent future alerts from being generated by the rule for that specific IP
address only. If either of the Source or Destination addresses are currently
being blocked by Snort, then a |fa-times| icon will also be shown. Clicking that
icon will remove the block for the IP address.

The SID column contains two icons. The |fa-plus-square-o| icon will
automatically add that SID to the :doc:`Suppress List </ids-ips/setup-snort-package>`
for the interface and suppress future alerts from the signature for all IP
addresses. The |fa-times| icon in the SID column will disable the rule and
remove it from the enforcing rule set. When a rule is manually disabled, the
icon in the SID column changes to |fa-times-circle|.
