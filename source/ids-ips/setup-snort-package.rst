Configuring the Snort Package
=============================

Snort is an intrusion detection and prevention system. It can be configured to
simply log detected network events to both log and block them. Thanks to
OpenAppID detectors and rules, Snort package enables application
detection and filtering. The package is available to install in the pfSenseÂ®
webGUI from **System > Package Manager**. Snort operates using detection
signatures called rules. Snort rules can be custom created by the user, or any
of several pre-packaged rule sets can be enabled and downloaded.

The Snort package currently offers support for these pre-packaged rules:

-  Snort VRT (Vulnerability Research Team) rules
-  Snort GPLv2 Community Rules
-  Emerging Threats Open Rules
-  Emerging Threats Pro Rules
-  OpenAppID Open detectors and rules for application detection

The Snort GPLv2 Community Rules and the Emerging Threats Open Rules are
both available for free with no registration required. The Snort VRT
rules are offered in two forms. One is a registered-user version which
is free, but requires registration at http://www.snort.org. The
registered-user free version only provides access to rules that are
30-days old or more in age. A Snort VRT paid subscription can be
purchased, and it offers twice-weekly (and sometimes more frequent)
updates to the rules. The Emerging Threats Pro rules are offered to paid
subscribers only and offer almost daily updates to address fast-changing
threats.

We strongly suggest obtaining a paid subscription from Snort or Emerging
Threats in order to download the most current rules. This is highly
recommended for commercial applications.

Launching Snort configuration GUI
---------------------------------

To launch the Snort configuration application, navigate to **Services >
Snort** from the menu in the pfSense webGUI.

Setting up Snort package for the first time
-------------------------------------------

Click the **Global Settings** tab and enable the rule set downloads to
use. If either the Snort VRT or the Emerging Threats Pro rules are
checked, a text box will be displayed to enter the unique subscriber
code obtained with the subscription or registration.

More than one rule set may be enabled for download, but note the
following caveats. If a paid subscription is available for the Snort VRT
rules, then all of the Snort GPLv2 Community rules are automatically
included within the file downloaded with the Snort VRT rules; therefore,
do not enable the GPLv2 Community rules if a paid-subscriber account is
used for the Snort VRT rules. All of the Emerging Threats Open rules are
included within the paid subscription for the Emerging Threats Pro
rules. If the Emerging Threats Pro rules are enabled, the Emerging
Threats Open rules are automatically disabled.

Once the desired rule sets are enabled, next set the interval for Snort
to check for updates to the enabled rule packages. Use the **Update
Interval** drop-down selector to choose a rule update interval. In most
cases every *12* hours is a good choice. The update start time may be
customized if desired. Enter the time as hours and minutes in 24-hour
time format. The default start time is *3* minutes past midnight local
time. So with a *12*-hour update interval selected, Snort will check the
Snort VRT or Emerging Threats web sites at 3 minutes past midnight and 3
minutes past noon each day for any posted rule package updates.

Update the rules
----------------

The **Updates** tab is used to check the status of downloaded rules
packages and to download new updates. The table shows the available rule
packages and their current status (not enabled, not downloaded, or a
valid MD5 checksum and date).

Click on the **Update Rules** button to download the latest rule package
updates. If there is a newer set of packaged rules on the vendor web
site, it will be downloaded and installed. The determination is made by
comparing the MD5 of the local file with that of the remote file on the
vendor web site. If there is a mismatch, a new file is downloaded. The
**FORCE** button can be used to force download of the rule packages from
the vendor web site no matter how the MD5 hash tests out.

In the screenshot below, the Snort VRT and Emerging Threats Open rule
packages have been successfully downloaded. The calculated MD5 hash and
the file download date and time are shown. Also note the last update
time and result are shown in the center of the page.

Add Snort to an interface
-------------------------

Click the **Snort Interfaces** tab and then the |fa-plus| icon to add a new
Snort interface.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortaddinterface.png
   :align: center

A new Interface Settings tab will open with the next available interface
automatically selected. The interface selection may be changed using the
**Interface** drop-down if desired. A descriptive name may also be
provided for the interface. Other interface parameters may also be set
on this page. Be sure to click the **SAVE** button down at the bottom of
the page when finished.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortinterfacesettings.png
   :align: center

After saving, the browser will be returned to the **Snort Interfaces**
tab. Note the warning icons in the image below showing no rules have
been selected for the new Snort interface. Those rules will be
configured next. Click the |fa-pencil| icon (shown highlighted with a red box in
the image below) to edit the new Snort interface again.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortinterfacesedit.png

Select which types of rules will protect the network
----------------------------------------------------

Click the **Categories** tab for the new interface.

If a Snort VRT Oinkmaster code was obtained (either free registered user
or the paid subscription), enabled the Snort VRT rules, and entered the
Oinkmaster code on the Global Settings tab then the option of choosing
from among three pre-configured IPS policies is available. These greatly
simplify the process of choosing enforcing rules for Snort to use when
inspecting traffic. The IPS policies are only available when the Snort
VRT rules are enabled.

The three Snort VRT IPS Policies are: (1) Connectivity, (2) Balanced and
(3) Security. These are listed in order of increasing security. However,
resist the temptation to immediately jump to the most secure *Security*
policy if Snort is unfamiliar. False positives can frequently occur with
the more secure policies, and careful tuning by an experienced
administrator may be required.

.. tip:: If Snort is unfamiliar, then using the less restrictive
   *Connectivity* policy in non-blocking mode (the default setting) is
   recommended as a starting point so that you can whitelist false
   positives. Once experience with Snort has been gained in this network
   environment, blocking mode may be enabled (via the **Block Offenders**
   option in the **Snort Interface Settings** tab) and a more restrictive
   IPS policy may be chosen.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortchooseipspolicy.png

If the Snort VRT rules were not enabled, or if any of the other rule
packages are to be used, then make the rule category selections by
checking the checkboxes beside the rule categories to use.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortmanualcategoryselection.png
   :align: center

Be sure to click **SAVE** when finished to save the selection and build
the rules file for Snort to use.

Starting Snort on an interface
------------------------------

Click the **Snort Interfaces** tab to display the configured Snort interfaces.
Click the |fa-times-circle| icon (shown highlighted with a red box in the image
below) to start Snort on an interface.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortinterfacesstart.png
   :align: center

It will take several seconds for Snort to start. Once it has started, the icon
will change to |fa-check-circle| as shown below. To stop a running Snort
instance on an interface, click the |fa-check-circle| icon.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortinterfacesrunning.png
   :align: center

Select which types of signatures will protect the network
---------------------------------------------------------

Click the **Rules** tab for the interface to configure individual rules
in the enabled categories. Generally this page is only used to disable
particular rules that may be generating too many false positives in a
particular network environment. Be sure they are in fact truly false
positives before taking the step of disabling a Snort rule!

Select a rules category from the **Category** drop-down to view all the assigned
rules. Click the |fa-check-circle| or |fa-check-circle-o| icon at the far-left
of a row to toggle the rule's state from enabled to disabled, or click
|fa-times-circle| or |fa-times-circle-o| to toggle from disabled to enabled. The
icon will change to indicate the state of the rule. At the top of the rule list
is a legend showing the icons used to indicate the current state of a rule.

Managing blocked hosts
----------------------

The **Blocked** tab shows what hosts are currently being blocked by
Snort (when the block offenders option is selected on the **Interface
Settings** tab). Blocked hosts can be automatically cleared by Snort at
one of several pre-defined intervals. The blocking options for an
interface are configured on the Snort **Interface Settings** tab for the
interface.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortblockedhosts.png
   :align: center

Managing Pass lists
-------------------

Pass Lists are lists of IP addresses that Snort should never block.
These may be created and managed on the **Pass Lists** tab. When an IP
address is listed on a Pass List, Snort will never insert a block on
that address even when malicious traffic is detected.

To create a new Pass List, click |fa-plus|. To edit an existing Pass List,
click the |fa-pencil|. To delete a Pass List, click |fa-trash|. Note that a Pass List
may not be deleted if it is currently assigned to one or more Snort
interfaces.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortpasslists.png
   :align: center

A default Pass List is automatically generated by Snort for every
interface, and this default list is used when no other list is
specified. Pass Lists are assigned to an interface on the **Interface
Settings** tab.

Customized Pass List may be created and assigned to an interface. This
might be done when trusted external hosts exist that are not located on
networks directly connected to the firewall. To add external hosts in
this manner, first create an Alias under **Firewall > Aliases** and then
assign that alias to the **Assigned Aliases** field. In the example
shown below, the alias "*Friendly_ext_hosts*" has been assigned. This
alias would contain the IP addresses of the trusted external hosts.

When creating a custom Pass List, leave all the auto-generated IP
addresses checked in the **Add auto-generated IP addresses** section.
Not selecting the checkboxes in this section can lead to blocking of
critical addresses including the firewall interfaces themselves. This
could result in being locked out of the firewall over the network! Only
uncheck boxes in this section when absolutely necessary.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortpasslistedit.png
   :align: center

Click the **ALIASES** button to open a window showing previously defined
aliases for selection. Remember to click **SAVE** to save changes.

.. note:: Remember that simply creating a Pass List is only the first
   step! It must be selected by going to the **Interface Settings** tab for
   the Snort interface and assigning the newly created Pass List as shown
   below. After assigning and saving the new Pass List, restart Snort on
   the affected interface to pick up the change.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortassignpasslist.png

Alert Thresholding and Suppression
----------------------------------

Suppression Lists allow control over the alerts generated by Snort
rules. When an alert is suppressed, then Snort no longer logs an alert
entry (or blocks the IP address if block offenders is enabled) when a
particular rule fires. Snort still inspects all network traffic against
the rule, but even when traffic matches the rule signature, no alert
will be generated. This is different from disabling a rule. When a rule
is disabled, Snort no longer tries to match it to any network traffic.
Suppressing a rule might be done in lieu of disabling the rule when
alerts should only be stopped based on either the source or destination
IP. For example, to suppress the alert when traffic from a particular
trusted IP address is the source. If any other IP is the source or
destination of the traffic, the rule would still fire. To eliminate all
alerts from the rule, then it is more efficient to simply disable the
rule rather than to suppress it. Disabling the rule will remove it from
Snort's list of match rules and therefore makes for less work Snort has
to do.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortsuppresslists.png
   :align: center

On the Suppress List Edit page, a new suppress list entry may be
manually added or edited. It is usually easier and faster to add
suppress list entries by clicking |fa-plus| shown with the alert entries on
the **Alerts** tab. Remember to click the **SAVE** button to save
changes when manually editing Suppress List entries.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortsuppresslistedit.png
   :align: center

Getting to know the alerts
--------------------------

The **Alerts** tab is where alerts generated by Snort are viewed. If
Snort is running on more than one interface, choose the interface whose
alerts should be viewed in the drop-down selector.

Use the **DOWNLOAD** button to download a gzip tar file containing all
of the logged alerts to a local machine. The **CLEAR** button is used to
erase the current alerts log. Destination IP's have been redacted from
the screenshot.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortalerts.png
   :align: center

**Alert Details**

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/snortalertdetails.png
   :align: center

The **Date** column shows the date and time the alert was generated. The
remaining columns show data from the rule that generated the alert.

In the **Source**, **Destination** columns are |fa-search| icons for performing
reverse DNS lookups on the IP addresses as well as a |fa-plus| icon used to add
an automatic :doc:`Suppress List </ids-ips/setup-snort-package>` entry for the
alert using the IP address and SID (signature ID). This will prevent future
alerts from being generated by the rule for that specific IP address only. If
either of the Source or Destination addresses are currently being blocked by
Snort, then a |fa-trash| icon will also be shown. Clicking that icon will remove
the block for the IP address.

The SID column contains two icons. The |fa-plus| icon will
automatically add that SID to the :doc:`Suppress
List </ids-ips/setup-snort-package>` for the
interface and suppress future alerts from the signature for all IP
addresses. The |fa-times| icon in the SID column will disable the
rule and remove it from the enforcing rule set. When a rule is manually
disabled, the icon in the SID column changes to |fa-times-circle|.

Application ID detection with OpenApp ID
----------------------------------------

OpenAppID is an application-layer network security plugin for the open
source intrusion detection system Snort. Learn more about it
`here <https://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco-announces-openappid-the-next-open-source-game-changer-in-cybersecurity/>`__.

Enabling OpenAppID and its rules is done from Snort **Global Settings**.
Select both checkboxes to enable detectors and rules download. Save the
page.

.. image:: /_static/ids-ips/enablingopenappid.png
   :align: center

After enabling the detectors and rules go to Snort Updates tab and click
on **Update Rules**. Wait for all the rules to update. Once done, the
page will show OpenAppID detectors and rules have been updated.
