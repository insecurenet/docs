pfSenseÂ® software can act in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) / Intrusion
Prevention System (IPS) role with add-on packages like Snort and Suricata.

.. note:: The Snort and Suricata packages share many design similarities, so
   in most cases the instructions for Snort carry over to Suricata with only
   minor adjustments.
