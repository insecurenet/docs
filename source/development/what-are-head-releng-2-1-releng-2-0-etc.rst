What are HEAD, RELENG 2 1, RELENG 2 0, etc
==========================================

This is the terminology used to refer to a specific git branch of
pfSenseÂ® source code.

HEAD (master)

HEAD, also known as -HEAD or "master", refers to the development version
of pfSense software, where all new features are first added. When a
release nears, HEAD is branched to a RELENG (Release Engineering) branch. This
follows the FreeBSD project's development model.

RELENG_2_3_0
------------

This branch is under active maintenance for 2.3 errata.
