Getting Started with pfSense Software Development
=================================================

There is no single specific starting point for joining the pfSenseÂ®
development effort, but the following items are helpful in getting
started:

-  Review the :doc:`Developer Style Guide </development/developer-style-guide>`
-  Become familiar with the `pfSense git
   repositories <https://github.com/pfsense>`__ (and
   `github <https://github.com>`__ in general):

   -  Current repositories used for developing pfSense software and its
      dependencies:

         Build information for supporting software used in pfSense software,
         and code for some of our custom programs/daemons/modules and
         packages

   -  Older repositories which are not used for current/new development:
