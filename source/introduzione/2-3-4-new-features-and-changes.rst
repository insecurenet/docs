-  See the Certificates section below for an important note about GUI

Certificates
------------

-  Improved certificate generation to always include the CN as the first
   Subject Alternative Name (SAN), which fixes issues with Chrome 58+
   `#7496 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7496>`__

   -  To work around an error with the firewall GUI certificate on
      Chrome 58+, take one of the following actions:

      -  Generate and activate a new GUI certificate automatically, from
         the console/shell: pfSsh.php playback generateguicert
      -  Utilize the :doc:`ACME package </certificates/acme-package>` to generate a
         trusted certificate for the GUI via Let's Encrypt
      -  Create your own new CA/Server certificate and use that for the
         GUI
      -  Activate the local browser
         "`EnableCommonNameFallbackForLocalAnchors <https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#EnableCommonNameFallbackForLocalAnchors>`__"
         option in Chrome 58 (this setting will be removed by Chrome
         eventually, so this is only a temporary fix)
