   `#7981 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7981>`__

Interfaces
----------

-  Changed the VLAN interface names to use the 'dotted' format of

   smaller than the limit (16) This fixes the 4 digit VLAN issues when
   the NIC name is 6 bytes long.

   stop when there are no more interfaces to assign

   'IP/mask' notation

   on a link up event, or else they can get stuck in a loop

   speed in some cases
   `#7814 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7814>`__
-  Fixed the DNS Resolver (Unbound) to allow snoop from localhost by
   default, otherwise "dig +trace" or "drill -T" queries from the
   firewall itself fail
   `#7884 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7884>`__

XMLRPC
