2.4.4-p3 New Features and Changes
=================================

pfSenseÂ® software version 2.4.4-p3 addresses security and other issues found in
:doc:`2.4.4-p2 <2-4-4-p2-new-features-and-changes>`.

.. tip:: For those who have not yet updated to 2.4.4-p2 or 2.4.4, consult
   the :doc:`previous release notes <index>` and `blog posts for those releases
   <https://www.netgate.com/blog/category.html#releases>`__ to read all
   important information and warnings before proceeding.

.. warning:: The upcoming pfSense release version 2.5.0 deprecates the built-in
   load balancer, and all related code has been removed as it is not compatible
   with FreeBSD 12. Plan migrations to alternate solutions such as the HAProxy
   package now.

   See the :doc:`2.5.0 release notes <2-5-0-new-features-and-changes>`
   for more information.
