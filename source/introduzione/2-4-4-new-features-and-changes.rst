2.4.4 New Features and Changes
==============================

Significant Changes
-------------------

:OS Upgrade: Base Operating System upgraded to FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE-p3. As a
  part of moving to FreeBSD 11.2, new hardware support is included for
  C3000-based hardware.
:PHP 7.2: PHP upgraded to 7.2, which required numerous changes to syntax
  throughout the source code and packages.
:Routed IPsec (VTI): Routed IPsec is now possible using using FreeBSD
  ``if_ipsec(4)`` Virtual Tunnel Interfaces (VTI).
  `#8544 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/8544>`__
  (See also: :doc:`/vpn/ipsec/ipsec-routed`)
:IPsec Speed Improvements: The new **Asynchronous Cryptography** option under
  the IPsec **Advanced Settings** tab can dramatically improve IPsec performance
  on multi-core hardware `#8772 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/8772>`__
:Default Gateway Group: The default gateway may now be configured using a
  Gateway Group setup for failover (each gateway on a different tier), which
  replaces Default Gateway Switching.
  `#8187 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/8187>`__
:Limiter AQM/Queue Schedulers: Limiters now include support for several Active
  Queue Management (AQM) methods and Queue Scheduler configurations such as
  FQ_CODEL.
  `#6620 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/6620>`__
  (See also: `pfSense PR #3941 <https://github.com/pfsense/pfsense/pull/3941>`__)
:Certificate Subject Requirements: The Certificate Manager and OpenVPN wizard
  now only require the **Common Name** to be set, and all other fields are
  optional.
  `#8381 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/8381>`__
:AutoConfigBackup is free!: AutoConfigBackup now integrated and `free for all to
  use <https://www.netgate.com/blog/pfsense-gold-free-starting-with-2-4-4.html>`__.
  (See also: :doc:`/backup/autoconfigbackup`)
:DNS over TLS: The DNS Resolver now includes support for DNS over TLS as both a
  client and a server, including for domain overrides.
  `#8388 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/8388>`__
  `#8030 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/8030>`__
  `#8431 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/8431>`__
:Captive Portal Authentication: Captive Portal authentication is now integrated
  with the User Manager system. Captive Portal instances may now use RADIUS,
  LDAP, or Local Authentication like other integrated services. The firewall
  will migrate existing Captive Portal RADIUS settings to the User Manager
  automatically on upgrade.
:Captive Portal HTML Design and Usability: The default Captive Portal page has
  been redesigned. Controls have also been added which allow for the logo and
  background images and Terms of Service text to be customized without editing
  and uploading custom HTML code.
  `#8793 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/8793>`__
:Integrated Switch Improvements: Netgate devices with integrated switches such
  as the SG-3100 and XG-7100 can now configure per-port speed and duplex
  settings, discrete port configuration interfaces can now be tied to switch
  ports for up/down status, and LAGG support is also now available (Load Balance
  mode only)

Errata
------

.. warning:: Third party packages from **alternate repositories** are causing
   problems for users with the upgrade process and also with post-upgrade
   behavior. These packages have never been supported, and had to be manually
   added by users outside of the GUI.

   Due to the major changes required for FreeBSD 11.2 and PHP 7.2, third party
   packages from alternate repositories cannot be present during the upgrade.
   There is no way to predict if a third party package supports the new version
   or will cause the upgrade itself to fail.

   The upgrade process will automatically remove ``pfSense-pkg-*`` packages
   installed from alternate repositories. After the upgrade completes, the user
   can reinstall these packages. Packages from **alternate repositories** will
   not appear in the **Installed Packages** list in the GUI, and must be
   entirely managed in the command line.

   **This change does not affect packages installed from the official pfSenseÂ®
   package repository.**
