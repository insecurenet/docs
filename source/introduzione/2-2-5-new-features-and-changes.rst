Security/Errata Notices
-----------------------

      Multiple vulnerabilities in NTP [REVISED]
   -  `FreeBSD-SA-15:14.bsdpatch <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-15:14.bsdpatch.asc>`__:
      Due to insufficient sanitization of the input patch stream, it is
      possible for a patch file to cause patch(1) to run commands in
      addition to the desired SCCS or RCS commands.
   -  `FreeBSD-SA-15:16.openssh <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-15:16.openssh.asc>`__:
      OpenSSH client does not correctly verify DNS SSHFP records when a
      server offers a certificate.
      `CVE-2014-2653 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2653>`__
      OpenSSH servers which are configured to allow password
      authentication using PAM (default) would allow many password
      attempts.
   -  `FreeBSD-SA-15:18.bsdpatch <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-15:18.bsdpatch.asc>`__:
      Due to insufficient sanitization of the input patch stream, it is
      possible for a patch file to cause patch(1) to pass certain ed(1)
      scripts to the ed(1) editor, which would run commands.
   -  `FreeBSD-SA-15:20.expat <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-15:20.expat.asc>`__:
      Multiple integer overflows have been discovered in the
      XML_GetBuffer() function in the expat library.
   -  `FreeBSD-SA-15:21.amd64 <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-15:21.amd64.asc>`__:
      If the kernel-mode IRET instruction generates an #SS or #NP
      exception, but the exception handler does not properly ensure that
      the right GS register base for kernel is reloaded, the userland GS
      segment may be used in the context of the kernel exception
      handler.
   -  `FreeBSD-SA-15:22.openssh <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-15:22.openssh.asc>`__:
      A programming error in the privileged monitor process of the
      sshd(8) service may allow the username of an already-authenticated
      user to be overwritten by the unprivileged child process. A
      use-after-free error in the privileged monitor process of the
      sshd(8) service may be deterministically triggered by the actions
      of a compromised unprivileged child process. A use-after-free
      error in the session multiplexing code in the sshd(8) service may
      result in unintended termination of the connection.
