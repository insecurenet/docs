Known Issues
------------

-  The Captive Portal **Disconnect All Users** button does not fully
   disconnect all users
   `PR#3565 <https://github.com/pfsense/pfsense/pull/3565>`__
-  RFC 2136 Dynamic DNS Entries will show red on the Dashboard widget
   even when correctly updated
   `#7290 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7290>`__
-  If an OpenVPN server set for *SSL/TLS+User Auth* contains a single
   user certificate shared between multiple users with different
   usernames, the **Duplicate Connections** option must be enabled on
   the server. In this situation, each user must have their own unique
   certificate or the certificate requirement should be removed (User
   Auth only). As this configuration is not valid nor a recommended
   practice, this issue is not considered a bug. When this condition is
   present only a single user can connect, additional users may see a
   client log entry such as "CreateIpForwardEntry: The object already
   exists".
-  Firewall rules without an IP protocol set in the configuration which
   also have an ICMP type set may not load or display correctly.
