Interfaces
----------

-  Updated em/igb/ixgb/ixgbe drivers that add support for i210 and i354
   NICs and fix issues with ``ix(4)`` cards.
-  Prevent assigned vlans from having their tag changed.
-  Fix ifconfig error on gif in certain cases.
-  If rc.newwanip is run on an interface that should not have an IP
   address, do not take any action. This could lead to certain
   interfaces bouncing link if they had no IP address.
-  In rc.newwanip, if the interface is configured and not enabled, bail.
   We do not need to change settings for disabled interfaces.
   `#3313 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3313>`__

   GUI and wizard). `#3196 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3196>`__
-  Reduce unnecessary operations and other fixes to MTU code. This fixes
   slow boot times and proper handling of mtu for VLANs.
-  Provide a dynamic gateway for GIF and GRE v6 tunnels so it can be
   used on firewall rules etc.
   `#3484 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3484>`__
-  Bring up appropriate interface for GRE/GIF.
   `#3281 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3281>`__
-  Prevent removing the IP from the underlying GRE interface in the OS
   when assigning GRE interface and configuring an IP address.
   `#3280 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3280>`__
-  When an interface goes down try to shut the RAs and dhcpd6 service on
   that interface. `#2627 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/2627>`__
-  Sync up ALTQ-capable interfaces list
-  Trigger rc.newwaipv6 from pppoe when it gets an inet6 configuration

   $disabled is true. `#3291 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3291>`__
-  Don't flush interface cache on each call of the function when looping
   through all gateways.
-  Fix an issue that changes wrong gateway entry when items are hidden
-  Delete static route when monitor IP is removed, also save monitor IP
   even when it's disabled
-  Return Gateway Group IP protocol version even when no gateway IP can
   be located.
-  Remove broken 'dynamic6' gateway, we already have ipprotocol to tell
   us the IP version, leave it more simple using only 'dynamic'

NAT/Firewall Rules/Aliases
--------------------------

-  Reload filter rules when activate or deactivate dhcpdv6
   `#3218 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3218>`__
-  Make sure no extra spaces end up in the parsed IP in the filter logs
   as it can lead to issues in other places (Easy Rule, etc)
-  Use (self) rather than any as the destination for the lockout rules
-  Use (self) instead of any for web lockout
-  Avoid pf table names conflict.
   `#3268 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3268>`__
-  Fix display of full URL in URL table listing as seen in an Alias
   popup. `#3242 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3242>`__
-  Make it more explicit that 'update freq.' for URL table aliases unit
   is days
-  Fix situation where removing an alias entry and then adding a new one
   resulted in an entry box with broken formatting.
   `#3283 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3283>`__
-  Make sure pf rule labels never have more than 63 chars.
   `#3208 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3208>`__
-  Rewrite the display_host_results() function to use spaces instead
   of tabs. It does a much better job of aligning the fields in each
   column and works in all the browsers, particularly chrome which
   doesn't support the tab character.
-  Handle comma-separated list of remote networks when making
   vpn_networks table
-  Fix rules that pass out traffic for Proxy ARP VIP entries which had
   incorrect destination
   `#3331 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3331>`__
-  Load only the options rather than clearing the whole ruleset.
-  Validate IP address ranges correctly on Alias Bulk Import
-  Fix display of CIDR/Update Freq in Alias Edit
-  In the filter log, the protocol might also say "icmpv6" so account
   for that when making a rule using Easy Rule.
-  Move 'allow dhcpv6 client' rules above block bogonsv6 ones.
   `#3395 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3395>`__
-  Only add dhcpv6 client allow rules if ipv6allow is set
-  Add all advanced options to rule table hover text.
-  Open up Firewall Rules Advanced Options section if any values have
   been set.
-  Validate rule Advanced Options numeric entries properly
-  Disable default allow incoming rules for 6to4 and 6rd interfaces.
   This rule unintentionally allows all services on the interface.
-  Skip OpenVPN interfaces when creating the first set of manual rules
   to be consistent with the behavior of Automatic Outbound NAT.
   `#3528 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3528>`__
-  Try to restore last working ruleset rather than staying without
   configuration at all if an invalid ruleset is encountered.
-  Fix days and weeks selection on schedules
-  Prevent prevent putting an subnet in the IPv6 address field since it
   then breaks the filter generation process.
-  Put a timeout of 30 seconds on the bogon update download.
   `#3412 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3412>`__
-  Before downloading file to process urltable, there is a random wait
   time between 5 and 60 seconds. Because of this, the difference
   between file mtime and current time can be less than $freq \* 86400
   and it'll be skipped. Add 90 seconds (60 of max random wait + 30 just
   to be sure) to avoid skipping a file that should be updated.
   `#3469 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3469>`__
-  Validate if src OR dst have IP address set when protocol is IPv4+v6.
   `#3499 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3499>`__
-  Improve data validation to avoid save a host/subnet or a IPv4 with
   invalid mask. The reported error is on javascript and only happen on
   IE8, but this fix will prevent the same issue happening in the future
   on a different browser.
   `#3449 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3449>`__

   in limiters.
-  Add previously missing DSCP VA.
-  Clarify note on limiter queue weight to state that higher values get
   a larger share.

   when deciding if a widget function should be called. This allows the
   system information dashboard widgets to update properly.
-  Avoid dashboard divide by zero errors
-  Detect Zones and Cores for thermal sensors using regex.
   `#3337 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3337>`__
-  Do not sort users when adding privileges. It's unnecessary and lead
   to unintentional edits to the wrong account.
-  Add specific privilege for easyrule.
-  Return all stats when all or remote is selected on Traffic Graph and
   make the default query return "Local" traffic.
-  Update year, links for 2.1.1.

-  Prevent a possible division by zero in Captive Portal.
   `#3212 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3212>`__
-  Fix saving of voucher sync settings
-  Reduce the total minutes by the remote minutes used, do not use the
   value directly. Otherwise the voucher will be cut short or listed
   invalid when it otherwise should have time left over.
-  Make sure to give the Captive Portal zone a name during the upgrade,
   or else it comes through with a blank/null name.
-  Properly set zone dedicated rules in the rules/pipes DBs to properly
   release when a zone is deactivated
-  Don't generate rules for disabled captive portal instances
-  Do some more error checking and put secondary radius attributes only
   if configured on a Captive Portal instance.

   for MAC passthrough.
-  Fix various problems with Captive Portal voucher synchronization
   introduced during conversion to zones.

   values.
-  Fix deletion of IPFW rules and pipes for passthru MAC.
   `#3538 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3538>`__
-  Use the 11th column for the radius context rather than overriding the
   interim interval field with it.
   `#3447 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3447>`__
-  Use descr as the field name for voucher description so it gets CDATA
   protection. `#3441 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3441>`__
-  Consider setting of noconcurrent login for passthrough expiration of
   users. `#3340 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3340>`__
-  Use the default bandwidth specification if configured even for
   allowed IP address and hostname.
-  Properly detect when there are issues with communicating with syncip
   and to use the local DB for this. Otherwise detect if the remote says
   the voucher is not valid say its not valid.

   correct 'Digest Algorithm'
-  OpenSSL does not like country codes longer than two letters, so
   remove entries that are not actually country codes.
-  Perform a much more accurate comparison between two certificates to
   determine if they are identical when checking their revocation
   status. `#3237 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3237>`__
-  Allow an "empty" CRL to be exported, since this is still a valid
   action.
-  Fixes for "Alternative Names" on certificates.
-  Fix issue with CSR generation.
   `#2820 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/2820>`__

   `#3514 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3514>`__

Load Balancing
--------------

-  We do not use nor include newsyslog, so remove the cron job from the
   default configuration and on upgrade.
-  Split SSL/TLS into separate checkboxes so that plaintext connections

   mail_reports.inc on 2c6efc9.
-  Fix console recent config restore, allow restoration of the last
   backup listed. `#3438 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3438>`__
-  Enhanced validation of general DNS servers and gateways
-  Add a mechanism by which the serial port can be forced on always
   regardless of the config setting. (useful for nano+vga setups)
-  Add a knob to let the user select which console (video or serial) is
   preferred in cases where there are multiple consoles present.
-  Skip input validation when choosing an existing certificate in the
   User Manager. `#3505 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3505>`__

   elegant and isn't necessary in the long run. It's better handled
   during the install process or while booted off other media (e.g. CD
   or Memstick).
