2.3.5 New Features and Changes
==============================

The pfSenseÂ® software version 2.3.x release is a Security and Errata maintenance release. 2.4.x is the primary
stable supported branch. If the firewall hardware is capable of running
2.4.x, consider upgrading to that release instead.

Updating to 2.3.5 from 2.3.4 on an amd64 installation that could
otherwise use 2.4.x requires configuring the firewall to stay on 2.3.x
as follows:

-  Navigate to **System > Update**, **Update Settings** tab
-  Set **Branch** to **Security / Errata Only**
-  Navigate back to the **Update** tab to see the latest 2.3.x update

If the update system offers an upgrade to 2.3.5 but the upgrade will not
proceed, ensure the firewall has correct versions of the repository
configuration and upgrade script for 2.3.x by running the following
commands from the console or shell::

  pkg install -fy pfSense-repo pfSense-upgrade

Firewalls running 32-bit (i386) installations of pfSense software do not
need to take any special actions to remain on 2.3.x as they are unable
to run later versions.
