-  pfSenseÂ® Security Advisories:

   -  `pfSense-SA-16_01.webgui <https://www.pfsense.org/security/advisories/pfSense-SA-16_01.webgui.asc>`__
   -  `pfSense-SA-16_02.webgui <https://www.pfsense.org/security/advisories/pfSense-SA-16_02.webgui.asc>`__

Several obsolete items were removed from this release. The items are
noted again in the sections below, but worth emphasizing:

-  The PPTP **VPN Server** has been completely removed. The protocol has
   been broken for over three years.

   -  The PPTP WAN client remains for use with ISPs still using PPTP.

-  Layer 7 classification support has been removed from the traffic
   shaper.

   -  It was rarely used, had been broken for all of 2.2.x, had absurdly
      high CPU usage, and snort filters better/faster

-  WEP support has been removed from Wireless interfaces.
   `#5123 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/5123>`__

   -  No reason to still be using this in this day and age. If it is
      still needed, use external AP.

-  Single DES support has been removed from IPsec (3DES remains).

   -  It should not be used, it is not secure.

-  1GB NanoBSD images have been removed, as they were not large enough
   to proper accommodate the system and upgrade data. The supported
   sizes for NanoBSD images are now 2GB and 4GB.
-  The default system password hash has been changed to bcrypt. Current
   passwords will continue to work. Existing users need to reset their
   password to convert to the new hash. More info below under
   "Authentication". `#4120 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4120>`__
-  The LiveCD platform has been removed. The ISO is a bootable
   installer, as always, but it cannot run a live system.

   -  The installer ISO image is now named "pfSense--RELEASE-.iso", with
      the .iso extension signifying the type of image it is (optical
      media installer).
   -  For the very few people who were still using LiveCD, if the
      hardware can boot from USB, install to a USB thumb drive and run
      from it instead. If the options to keep /var and /tmp in RAM are
      active, and no packages are installed, the net result should be
      similar but ultimately more functional.

Dashboard/Widgets/GUI
---------------------

-  Converted GUI to the `Bootstrap framework`_, completely new look
-  Changed the GUI and Captive Portal web server to nginx; removed
   lighttpd. `#5719 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/5719>`__

   than the old confusing icon set (now using font-awesome icons)

   implemented, and had no GUI option.

   instead. All password fields have also been changed to require
   confirmation.
-  Many pages have been reworked for improved internationalization
-  Changed info box functions, removed print_info_box_np, now
   print_info_box and print_apply_box are used to print appropriate
   boxes without problematic automatic detection
-  Moved RRD graphs to **Status > Monitoring**
   `#5498 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/5498>`__
-  Changed RRD GUI interface to D3 rather than using the RRD graph
   command, so that a newer rrdtool base could be used with minimal
   added dependencies.
   `#5498 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/5498>`__
-  Monitor IP added to gateways widget.
   `#4782 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4782>`__
