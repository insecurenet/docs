2.4 New Features and Changes
============================

Operating System / Architecture changes
---------------------------------------

-  Upgrade of base OS to FreeBSD **11.1-RELEASE-p1**
-  Added support for Netgate ARM-based systems such as the SG-1000
-  **32-bit support has been deprecated and removed** -- There are no
   images available for 32-bit (x86/i386) Intel architecture systems
-  **NanoBSD has been deprecated and removed** -- There are no images
   available for NanoBSD, use a full install instead

   -  For 64-bit systems running NanoBSD, see :doc:`Upgrading 64-bit NanoBSD 2.3 to 2.4 </install/upgrading-64-bit-nanobsd-2-3-to-2-4>` for
      information on how to upgrade in-place from NanoBSD to a full
      installation

-  Started using the FreeBSD installer instead of the old style
   installer (installation procedures have all changed)

   -  The installer now supports UEFI
      `#4044 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4044>`__
   -  If the new installer image will not boot on a specific piece of
      hardware, see :doc:`/hardware/boot-troubleshooting`
   -  The installer now supports ZFS
   -  Added support to the new installer to copy an existing config.xml
      off an MS DOS formatted USB drive (formerly known as "PFI")
      `#7689 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7689>`__
   -  Added support to the new installer to optionally recover
      config.xml off an existing installation drive (works with UFS and
      ZFS) `#7708 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7708>`__

-  Fixed issues with major version base upgrades via pkg
-  Changed cryptodev to load as a kernel module
   `#5976 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/5976>`__

Security / Errata
-----------------

-  Converted various parts of the GUI to use POST instead of GET when
   performing actions that change the firewall state (e.g. delete or
   enable/disable an item) to avoid potential issues with cross-site
   request forgery and unintentional repeating of actions
   `#4083 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4083>`__
-  FreeBSD 11.1 includes MAP_GUARD protection to protect against
   attacks such as Stack Clash
-  `pfSense-SA-17_07.packages <https://www.pfsense.org/security/advisories/pfSense-SA-17_07.packages.asc>`__
-  A number of base system packages have been updated to address
   security issues, including `dnsmasq,
   perl <https://www.netgate.com/blog/no-plan-survives-contact-with-the-internet.html>`__,
   cURL, and others.

Firmware Branch Behavior / Upgrading From Snapshots
---------------------------------------------------

-  To control how a firewall obtains updates, visit **System > Update**,
   **Update Settings** tab:
-  For users currently running 2.3.x-RELEASE:

   -  *Stable*, which is the default behavior, will upgrade the firewall
      to 2.4-RELEASE when it is complete, but will not upgrade to 2.4-RC
   -  *Development Snapshots* will upgrade the firewall to 2.3.5
      development snapshots
   -  *Next major version* will upgrade the firewall to 2.4-RC

-  For users tracking pfSenseÂ® software version 2.4 snapshots:

   -  *Stable*, which is the default behavior, will upgrade the firewall
      to 2.4-RC and eventually 2.4-RELEASE
   -  *Development Snapshots* will cause the firewall to continue
      tracking snapshots, bypassing 2.4-RELEASE and continuing on to
      2.4.1 development images

Known Issues
------------

-  Some systems may not be able to boot 2.4 installation images, for
   example, due to UEFI compatibility changes. These are primarily BIOS
   issues and not issues with the installer images. Upgrading from 2.3.x
   should still work on affected hardware.
-  Users with ESXi or VMware Workstation may experience a `boot-time
   crash during hardware
   detection <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7925>`__, due to `a
   race condition in the FreeBSD VT console
   code <https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=217282>`__.
   This crash is infrequent and does not affect most users or most boot
   attempts, but since it is a race condition it can manifest randomly.
   To avoid the crash, configure the VM to use the ``syscons`` console
   rather than ``vt`` by editing ``/boot/loader.conf.local`` and adding this
   line::

     kern.vty=sc

Cleanup
-------

-  Misc code cleanup, removal of patches that were no longer necessary
   or were inefficient
-  Replaced multiple local copies of PHP PEAR libraries with updated
   copies using their official sources
   `#3734 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3734>`__

   -  Notably, local static copies were replaced by their FreeBSD ports
      counterparts: pear, pear-XML_RPC2, pear-Net_IPv6,
      pear-Crypt_CHAP, pear-Mail, pear-Net_Growl
   -  Code that relied on the old files was updated to use the current
      or replaced versions

-  Removed all references to GLXSB (it was 32-bit only)
   `#6755 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/6755>`__
-  Removed all code in the builder and pfSense for handling the NanoBSD
   platform
-  Removed all calls to conf_mount_rw / conf_mount_ro, since they
   were only required for NanoBSD
-  Improved help text in various parts of the GUI

Wireless
--------

-  FreeBSD 11 contains an updated 802.11 stack with `numerous
   improvements <https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=287197>`__
-  Wireless interfaces **must** be created on the **Wireless** tab under

-  Fixed the Traffic Shaper so it shows interface names for disabled
   interfaces, rather than an 'empty' placeholder.
-  Fixed handling of the priority field for different ALTQ shaper types

OpenVPN
-------

-  Upgraded OpenVPN to 2.4.x.
   `#7054 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7054>`__

   -  This is a significant upgrade which includes support for a wide
      variety of new features, including AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM.
   -  AES-GCM can be accelerated by AES-NI, and is supported in SSL/TLS
      modes (not shared key)
      `#7068 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7068>`__
   -  Added support for TLS Encryption as an optional TLS Key usage
      type. This encrypts the control channel, providing privacy and
      protocol obfuscation
      `#7071 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7071>`__
   -  Added ECDH options to OpenVPN server and client options ("ECDH
      Only" choice for DH, ECDH Curve selection)
      `#7063 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7063>`__
   -  Restructured the compression options to include LZ4 support and
      the new "compress" directive which replaces "comp-lzo" which has
      been deprecated. The old options remain for now, but are labeled
      "Legacy" `#7064 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7064>`__
   -  Changed protocol selection for OpenVPN clients and servers because
      OpenVPN 2.4 treats "udp" and "tcp" as dual stack now
      `#7062 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7062>`__

      -  Added "multihome" option in relevant protocol cases so OpenVPN
         will reply back using the address used to receive a packet
         `#7062 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7062>`__

   -  Changed the DNS Server fields in the OpenVPN server options so
      they can define either IPv4 or IPv6 DNS servers to push to clients
      `#7061 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7061>`__
   -  Added IPv6 support to status_openvpn.php and the OpenVPN widget
      `#2766 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/2766>`__
   -  Removed uses of the deprecated "tun-ipv6" OpenVPN directive,
      OpenVPN now always assumes IPv6 is enabled
      `#7054 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7054>`__
   -  Replaced uses of the deprecated "client-cert-not-required"
      directive with its functional replacement "verify-client-cert
      none" `#7073 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7073>`__
   -  Added support for Negotiable Crypto Parameters (NCP) to control
      automatic cipher selection between clients and servers
      `#7072 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7072>`__
   -  NOTE: OpenVPN 2.4 handles CRL verification differently than
      previous versions, passing through validation to the library
      rather than handling it internally. This can cause some
      certificates to fail validation that may have passed previously.
      In particular, if a certificate is removed from a CRL, it may
      still fail validation until all copies of the CRL have been
      rewritten.

-  Improved the help text on OpenVPN Client-Specific Overrides
   `#7053 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7053>`__

-  Added an OpenVPN GUI option for "fast-io" to clients and servers
   `#7507 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7507>`__
-  Added an OpenVPN GUI Option for "sndbuf" and "rcvbuf", using the same
   value for both `#7507 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7507>`__
-  Removed references to the defunct OpenVPN client manager port
   `#7568 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7568>`__
-  Removed references to unused "Address Pool" setting in OpenVPN
   `#7567 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7567>`__
-  Fixed OpenVPN server port validation to disallow "0", while still
   allowing it for a client port, which is the same meaning as
   blank/empty `#7565 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7565>`__
-  Fixed OpenVPN help text for route_no_exec
   `#7575 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7575>`__
-  Fixed description of the address assignment behavior for Tunnel
   Network fields in OpenVPN clients and servers
   `#7573 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7573>`__
-  Remove the GUI option for "resolv-retry infinite" from OpenVPN, it is
   always enabled `#7572 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7572>`__
-  Fixed the OpenVPN wizard so it better handles a user choosing a
   different type of authentication server than a previous run of the
   wizard `#7569 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7569>`__
-  Fixed OpenVPN Auth Digest Algorithm selection so it does not use
   duplicate/alias names in the list, and added upgrade code to fix
   existing entries on upgrade so they use the actual digest name and
   not an alias `#7685 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7685>`__
-  Fixed show/hide behavior of fields on vpn_openvpn_client.php in
   chrome `#7451 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7451>`__
-  Changed OpenVPN wizard certificate input validation and encoding so
   it matches the standards of the current certificate manager
   `#7854 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7854>`__
-  Fixed the OpenVPN wizard so it creates an OpenVPN server instance
   using current proper defaults
   `#7864 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7864>`__

   vpn_ipsec_configure() by /etc/rc.newipsecdns
-  Added DH Groups 22, 23, 24 to IPsec Phase 2 selection for
   compatibility, but they should not normally be used for security
   reasons `#6967 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/6967>`__

Certificate Management
----------------------

-  Added a check to ensure that the public key of the Certificate

   `#7677 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7677>`__

   -  It is now possible to add SANs and EKUs to certificates when
      signing using the certificate manager
   -  NOTE: Attributes such as SANs and KU/EKU cannot be copied from a
      CSR when signing due to a deficiency in OpenSSL's x509 functions
      (they do not support "copy_extensions" at this time); These
      attributes must be specified manually when signing

-  Fixed "server" certificate detection to key off of the EKU For "TLS
   Web Server Authentication" since nsCertType has been deprecated
-  Added SAN, KU, and EKU information in an info block for each entry in
   the the certificate list
   `#7505 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7505>`__
