Configuring High Availability
=============================

**This guide is brief and omits important considerations.** The **Hardware
Redundancy** chapter in the |book_link| should be consulted before configuring a
high availability cluster utilizing CARP.

Overview of a pfSenseÂ® High Availability Setup
----------------------------------------------

One real IP address is required for every CARP cluster node. To have 2
cluster nodes, 2 IP addresses are needed for the real interfaces and
then an additional IP for each CARP type virtual IP address. In this
case it would amount to 3. In the example shown to the right, the IP
address of the primary CARP cluster node WAN is *127.29.29.1* and the IP
address of the secondary node WAN is *127.29.29.2*. The IP address of
the primary cluster node LAN is *192.168.1.2* and the IP address of the
secondary node LAN is *192.168.1.3*.

Add CARP Shared Virtual IP Addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the primary cluster node, add a virtual IP addresses of the CARP type
in **Firewall > Virtual IPs**. The virtual IP addresses must fall within
the same subnet of an IP address defined on a real interface (WAN, LAN,
OPT1, etc.). A unique VHID must be used for each shared virtual IP
address on a given interface. The lowest skew states that the node
should be the CARP master for that VIP. The XMLRPC process will
automatically add +100 to each skew when synchronizing the VIPs to the
secondary node. We recommend setting the skew to 0 or 1 on the primary
node CARP virtual IPs. pfSense software will handle the rest.

Setup a Dedicated Sync Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We strongly advise using a dedicated interface for synchronization,
especially for state synchronization, handled using pfsync. This is not
only for security purposes, but for resource utilization as well. State
synchronization can consume significant amounts of traffic in a busy
environment.

Set up each cluster **Sync** interface, give it an IP address in the
same subnet. Example: on the primary cluster node enter *192.168.4.1*
and on the secondary cluster node enter *192.168.4.2* for the IP
address. Use a /24 subnet.

Add Firewall Rules for Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before configuring synchronization, add firewall rules to the **Sync**
interface that will pass traffic between the nodes.

- Navigate to **Firewall > Rules** on the **Sync** interface tab
- Add a rule to pass traffic from the *Sync Net* to any destination.

This could be made more precise, with rules to only pass traffic to the
firewall GUI port and for pfsync.

Enable State Synchronization (pfsync)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

State synchronization should be enabled on all cluster nodes.

-  Navigate to **System > High Avail. Sync**
-  Check **Synchronize States**
-  Choose the correct **Synchronize Interface** for state
   synchronization
-  If using two cluster nodes, enter the sync interface IP address for
   the opposing node in **pfsync Synchronize Peer IP**.

    Using the above example, the primary cluster node would have
    *192.168.4.2* set. The secondary node would have *192.168.4.1* set.

-  Click Save

Enable Configuration Synchronization (XMLRPC Sync)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before proceeding, set the same user with the "System - HA node sync" 
privilege (or *admin* user), password and
webConfigurator protocol (e.g. HTTPS) on each cluster node.

The configuration synchronization settings should only be enabled on the
primary cluster node.

-  Navigate to **System > High Avail. Sync**
-  Enter the IP address of the secondary in **Synchronize Config to IP**
   (*192.168.4.2* from the above example)
-  Enter the user with the "System - HA node sync" privilege (or *admin* user)
   for the **Remote System Username**
-  Enter the **Remote System Password** (the password should be the same
   on all nodes)
-  Check boxes for the desired configuration areas to sync. Typically
   all of these will be selected.
-  Click Save

The chosen areas will synchronize to the secondary node once the
settings have been saved.

Setup Manual Outbound NAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Navigate to **Firewall > NAT** on the **Outbound** tab
-  Select **Manual outbound NAT**
-  Click save
-  Edit the automatically added rule for LAN

   -  Select a shared CARP virtual IP address on WAN as the *Translation
      address*
   -  Change the Description to refer to the rule's use of the CARP VIP
      if desired
   -  Click Save

-  Repeat the rule edit for additional rules
-  Click Apply changes

.. note:: Never add outbound NAT rules that could match the WAN/Public IP
   addresses of the cluster. This includes rules that have the public
   IP addresses listed explicitly and also rules that have *This Firewall (self)*
   or *any* set as a source. These NAT rules will cause other problems/unintended 
   behavior, and will break outbound connectivity from the secondary node when 
   it is in a BACKUP state.

Set DHCP Server to Use CARP LAN IP Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Navigate to **Services > DHCP Server** on the primary node
-  Click the **LAN** tab
-  Set the default gateway to the CARP VIP on the LAN, e.g.
   *192.168.1.3*
-  Set the DNS server to the CARP VIP on the LAN, e.g. *192.168.1.3*
-  Enter the IP address of the secondary node in **Failover peer IP**.
   This will be automatically adjusted during synchronization.
-  Click save

Verify XMLRPC Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visit the secondary cluster node and verify that NAT, Virtual IP
addresses and rules have been synchronized correctly.

Verify CARP Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On both nodes, check **Status > CARP (failover)**. If either system
shows a button labeled **Enable CARP**, click it.

On that page, verify that the VIPs show the proper status. On the
primary node, each VIP should show **MASTER**. On the secondary node,
each VIP should show **BACKUP**.

That's it, Enjoy!

Troubleshooting
---------------

See :doc:`CARP Configuration Sync Troubleshooting </highavailability/troubleshooting-xmlrpc-configuration-synchronization>`
and :doc:`CARP Configuration Troubleshooting </highavailability/troubleshooting-high-availability-clusters>`
for more information on correcting issues. A few common issues are
listed below.

VMware ESX Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Enable promiscuous mode on the vSwitch
#. Enable "MAC Address changes"
#. Enable "Forged transmits"

ESX VDS Config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a Virtual Distributed Switch is being used, it is possible to make a
port group for the firewall interfaces with promiscuous mode enabled,
and a separate non-promiscuous portgroup for other hosts. This has been
reported to work by users on the forum as a way to strike a balance
between the requirements for letting CARP function and for securing
client ports.

KVM+QEMU Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be sure to use e1000 NICs (em(4)), not the ed(4) NICs or CARP VIPs will
never leave init state.
