Backup and Restore
******************

Backups are a key element for most computing devices. Using a backup, a failed
pfSenseÂ® device can be up and running in only a few moments.

pfSense stores all of its settings in a central configuration file,
``config.xml``. A backup of this file can easily be used to restore pfSense to
a working state.
