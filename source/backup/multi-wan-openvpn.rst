Using OpenVPN with Multi-WAN
============================

OpenVPN servers can be used with any WAN, or multiple WANs, as can
OpenVPN clients. This document covers only a remote access OpenVPN
server, but a similar process could be applied for site to site VPNs.

There are many different ways to configure multiple WANs with OpenVPN on
pfSenseÂ® software for remote access or site to site VPNs. Many of these
were covered during the September 2014 |hangout_link|.

  |hangout_link|.

OpenVPN Configuration
---------------------

First, get OpenVPN working as desired on the primary WAN interface. Once
it is properly functioning, make a backup just in case.

Bind to Localhost and Setup Port Forwards
-----------------------------------------

The OpenVPN configuration needs to be adjusted so it can be reached from
either WAN. The simplest way to do this is by changing the **Interface**
on the VPN connection to be *Localhost*, and then adding a port forward
on each WAN to redirect the OpenVPN port to *Localhost* (127.0.0.1).

For example: If there are two WANs and the OpenVPN server is running on
port *1194*, set the **Interface** to *Localhost*, then add two port
forwards:

-  WAN1 - *UDP*, Source \*, Destination *WAN1 Address* port *1194*,
   redirect target *127.0.0.1* port *1194*
-  WAN2 - *UDP*, Source \*, Destination *WAN2 Address* port *1194*,
   redirect target *127.0.0.1* port *1194*

Configure Clients
-----------------

Clients may be configured to use the second WAN by adding a second
*remote* statement to their configuration, such as::

  remote x.x.x.x 1194 udp

Where *x.x.x.x* is the second WAN IP address or host name.

This process can be automated by using the OpenVPN Client Export
package. When exporting a client, in **Host Name Resolution** choose one
of:

-  Automagic Multi-WAN IPs (port forward targets): Adds a remote
   statement for each port forward found targeting the interface binding
   and port used by this VPN, uses the IP address of each WAN as-is.
-  Automagic Multi-WAN DDNS Hostnames (port forward targets): Like
   above, but uses the first located Dynamic DNS hostname for a given
   WAN. If the WAN is a private IP, this may be the better choice.

More than two WAN connections
-----------------------------

The same steps can be repeated to add more WAN connections. Add a port
forward to any additional WAN. Clients will need an updated
configuration file if another WAN is added later.
