Load Balancing Uneven Multi-WAN Connections
===========================================

In the pfSenseÂ® webGUI, navigate to **System > Routing**. Edit the
gateway, and select a **Weight** in the advanced options. The weight
sets the ratio for use of a gateway.

For example, if there are two gateways set with a weight of 3 and 1
respectively, then out of four connections, three will use the first
gateway, and one will use the second.
